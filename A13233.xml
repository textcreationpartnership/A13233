            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have done all, with as much diligence, as a Scholler <hi>(morally)</hi> might doe: yea with importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of diligence, have I ſollicited ſuch Gentlemen; as I knew to have beene in action, and that could teach me any thing. And ſomething more then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:18715:3"/> diligence, have I uſed in it. The <hi>Italian Painter</hi> hath 3. <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Compariſon,</hi> in the preferring of his <hi>Peeces.</hi> If he ſaies tis but done <hi>con diligenza,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; tis no great commendation of his paines, for he meanes no more then an ordinary diligence. His ſecond degree of prayſing it, is <hi>con ſtudio,</hi> with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and by that would he tell you, that his braine and hand; have a little more laboured, both upon the <hi>deſigning</hi> and the <hi>colouring.</hi> But if he addes <hi>con amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> that he did it with a <hi>love</hi> and an <hi>affection;</hi> to the <hi>Piece</hi> or <hi>Party;</hi> oh! tis <hi>di Madonna,</hi> then: and the <hi>Italian</hi> himſelfe is at the higheſt of his expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>I have (as little as might be, and eſpecially in the Kings <hi>Story</hi>) truſted to no <hi>written Relations;</hi> unleſſe received from a <hi>knowne hand,</hi> or confirmed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>eare-witneſſes.</hi> No, I have not ſingly relyed, ſo much as upon that diligent amaſſer of the <hi>Dutch Currantoes,</hi> the <hi>Gallobelgicus,</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Suecica; le Soldat Suedois,</hi> I meane by it: upon whoſe ſingle credit, I have no where written any thing; excepting in thoſe ſlighter encounters about <hi>Norimberg.</hi> And yet even there, had I beene in the ſame boxe, with him, and before him; the <hi>High Dutch Relations.</hi> I commend, (as much as any man) the queyntneſſe of his language; and the neatneſſe of his conceits, many times: which are the reliſhes of a <hi>French</hi> wittyneſſe in him. His beſt pieces, are the <hi>Abridgements of the lives of the two Kings.</hi> Divers of the conceits, therefore, of the firſt of theſe; have I made ſome uſe of, in my <hi>Character of the King of Sweden.</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> have I wholly taken into my
<pb facs="tcp:18715:3"/> 
                     <hi>Character of the King of Bohemia:</hi> and I had divers reaſons for it. Tis finely done; I was glad to ſee a <hi>Frenchman</hi> give that good King, his due; and twas ſafer for me to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> that, then to <hi>invent</hi> a new one. Beyond this, would I by this <hi>Eſſay</hi> of <hi>Tranſlating;</hi> try Maſteries with the <hi>French Language:</hi> I confeſſe my ſelfe to be but a bungling ſmatterer, at it; and yet thus farre dare I be depoſed, That had a queynt penne the doing of it, the <hi>French</hi> it ſelfe ſhould not be able to tranſcend our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the happineſſe of expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>For the truth of thoſe <hi>Relations,</hi> wherein I differ from that <hi>French Author;</hi> I report me to thoſe that have reade both, and have beene perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the <hi>Actions.</hi> And thus much (becauſe we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) had I reaſon to ſay in mine owne defence; and to prevent, withall, the abuſing of my Countrymen, ſhould he happen to be tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Mine owne ambition is not, that this Piece of mine ſhould be exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cenſuring, or to be taken for above the true value of it: nor doe I profeſſe my ſelfe to be other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (like an <hi>Architect</hi>) the <hi>diſpoſer of other mens Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, at my best value.</hi> I am <hi>Author</hi> of nothing, here, but of the miſtakings; &amp; even of thoſe, though I ſtrongly be <hi>ſuſpitious:</hi> yet am I, (no way) <hi>conſcious.</hi> Knowingly, I have committed nothing againſt <hi>Truth;</hi> nor tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced peeviſhly, the honour of any perſon. I could tell no more then I knew, nor would not: ſure, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have written all; but what I have, is neere about the matter.</p>
                  <p>In writing of this <hi>Story,</hi> thoſe two objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> againſt the likelyhood of all
<pb facs="tcp:18715:4"/> 
                     <hi>Histories;</hi> may appeare to be well ſatisfied. A <hi>Story-Writer</hi> (ſay thoſe <hi>Barbarians) In the time, dares not; and After the time, cannot,</hi> write truely. For the firſt of theſe: the <hi>diſtance of the place</hi> ſecures me, againſt the feare of writing <hi>too truely</hi> of the <hi>preſent.</hi> My ſelfe, (not ſince theſe warres) was never neere enough to the <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>places</hi> of <hi>action;</hi> to be either <hi>bribed</hi> or <hi>skared</hi> by them. And as for the Authors, whom chiefly I have conſulted; though they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gentlemen of the Army; yet have they now put themſelues beyond the <hi>feare</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> of <hi>pleaſing</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſing:</hi> becauſe out of the ſervice and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy. And as for the <hi>ſecond obiection,</hi> thats well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, too; for though my <hi>Story</hi> be written <hi>after the time</hi> of doing, yet not <hi>beyond the memory</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>And thus, in this Iland, have I done with this <hi>forraine Story;</hi> as in ſome <hi>Houſes of pleaſure,</hi> I have ſeene done with the <hi>Landtskip</hi> of a Countrey: where the <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Woodes,</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> have by <hi>Perſpective</hi> and <hi>Art Optick,</hi> beene ſo brought thorow a ſmall hole; that they have <hi>in little</hi> beene reflected upon a <hi>Paper,</hi> or <hi>poliſht Stone,</hi> in a <hi>Study</hi> or a <hi>Dyning-roome.</hi> And I have uſed the ſame <hi>Art Perſpective:</hi> the <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip</hi> of theſe <hi>Swediſh Warres,</hi> have beene out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> brought home into my <hi>Study,</hi> which my <hi>Paper</hi> here reflects off againe. <hi>In little,</hi> I meane, and as I could; and though not in their iuſt <hi>magnitude;</hi> yet ſomething towards their proportions.</p>
                  <p>If I have made my <hi>Readers</hi> waite, a while, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectancy of my <hi>Relations:</hi> I hope they will pleaſe to allow of this anſwer, for a ſatisfaction. That I
<pb facs="tcp:18715:4"/> onely ſaid, till falſe rumours might be contradicted; true reports, brought home to me, by men preſent; and the paſſions of people a little over, which might either make them harder of beleefe, or over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. My office (ſo hath God diſpoſed of it) hath beene, not that of an <hi>Historiographer</hi> alone, but of a <hi>Herald</hi> alſo: one, that having ſerved a Prince, firſt in denouncing of his <hi>Warres,</hi> and then in celebrating of his <hi>Triumphs;</hi> performes his laſt duties to him, at his <hi>Funeralls.</hi> So have my <hi>Three Bookes</hi> beene. My <hi>Firſt Part</hi> proclaimed, the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> comming into the Field, and the <hi>Cauſes</hi> for it. My <hi>Second Part</hi> marſhalled him along, all in <hi>Victories</hi> and in <hi>Glories:</hi> and my vnlucky <hi>Third,</hi> here waites upon him, in his <hi>Obſequies.</hi> The end of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> hath ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced his <hi>Intelligencer:</hi> it cannot be expected, that a <hi>Logician</hi> ſhould proceed in his <hi>Argument;</hi> after that the <hi>Adverſary</hi> hath taken away the <hi>Subiect of his Queſtion.</hi> I have done with <hi>Novelties,</hi> now; and I henceforth deſire my <hi>Readers</hi> to diſcharge me.</p>

That night, lay He within 4. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of the <hi>Bavarian:</hi> which had he ſurely knowne, he had without doubt, cut him all in pieces. But the Duke, that euening, hauing better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence where the King was; then the King had, where the Duke was: roſe with all ſpeed and haſtned towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> to conioyne with <hi>Wallenſtein:</hi> both of them preſently returning againe vpon the King.

                  </p>
                  <p>And now remembers he his Royall word, paſſed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the <hi>Norimbergers.</hi> Their towne, being mighty in power and example; had, at firſt, committed it ſelfe vnto his devotion: and he, againe, in the word of a King, had aſſured it of the uttermoſt of his protection.

                     </note> body and goods for it. Round about this Towne, we in our <hi>Second Part</hi> left him encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and there, he for 16. weeks after ſtaied: for that Townes ſake alone, ſubmitting himſelfe unto ſuch multitudes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18715:6"/> and ſo many varieties of great dangers; as his victorious proceedings had not hitherto beene confronted withall: all which, a farre meaner experience then a King of <hi>Swedens</hi> could not but foreſee, now ready like a tempeſt to come flowing in upon him.</p>
                  <p>His Highneſſe the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> had taken ſore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grett at this <hi>Norimberg;</hi> and, for its entertaining the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> had his Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> offered to beleager it.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Palatinate;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His reaſons for it.</note> it had beene an Inlett, withall, to his progreſſe into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſates of<note n="*" place="margin">They write themſelues <hi>Burgraves of Norimberg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Onspach</hi> and <hi>Payreit,</hi> belonging vnto 2. Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and by <hi>Onspach,</hi> into <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> The Imperiall <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> beſides, had now threatned to write it vp in <hi>red letters</hi> in his Almanack; to make a <hi>Martyr</hi> of it; and to change <hi>Norimberg,</hi> into <hi>Magdenburg:</hi> he had vow'd the City to the flames, and the riches of it, for a prey unto his ſouldiers. This danger, was the Towne now in; the more need, therefore, for the King to keepe his word with it.</p>
                  <p>And yet was it a <hi>mixt action,</hi> too: there were other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring cauſes, for the Kings ſitting downe about <hi>Norimberg,</hi> beſides the bare keeping of his promiſe with it. Theſe were ſome of the preuailing reaſons, that drew the King thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſhould he have left it vnto the fury of the enemy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the whole world might iuſtly haue condemn'd him, as a man more regardfull of his ſafety, then of his honour. Then, the Imperiall Cities (whoſe Champion he had heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe) perceiuing him ſo carefull to make his owne game, would alſo haue plaid the beſt of theirs: and <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> among the reſt, would quickely have falne off from him, and have ſaved its owne ſtake with the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Towne of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> was a Paſſe of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18715:7"/> importance: not onely, by the aduantage of its ſituation, which was its neighbourhood vnto a many ſmaller Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities (all in League with it) but a very conſiderable State like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of its ſelfe it is, for the largeneſſe of its owne Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſoile, indeed, is but woody and ſandy: but the Lordſhip of it, is (much what) ſixteene Engliſh miles ſquare, with about twenty good Towes, and ſixe or ſeuen skore vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages in it. <hi>Norimberg,</hi> therefore, was worth the looking after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the City it ſelfe had now giuen him an aſſurance, how excellent well it was provided; for the ſuſtaining of his Army: which, notwithſtanding that it maintained 30000 or 40000 people, for ſixteene weekes together, yet at the Kings riſing, was not bread much dearer, then ordinarily tis in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe three, together with the honour of keeping his word; were the chiefe of the reaſons for the Kings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping about <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Had he more entended the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his other victories, then the ſafety of this Towne; he might then haue marched vp into the Biſhop of <hi>Bambergs</hi> Country; and haue expected <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> in theſe quarters: and ſo by laying the ſeate of the warres, in that Biſhopricke, haue abundantly beene reuenged of that Prince; for the breache of his former promiſes. Againe, the Kings Armie was now but ſmall: for though it had the reputation of 20000 men, by the enſigne; yet ſurely (ſo weake were the Companies, that the forces of the Towne excepted) they could not muſter aboue 15500 reall marching men, to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned by the Poll. Had, therefore, the chiefe of his care beene, to haue firſt reenforced his Legions; and then to haue returned vpon the enemy: he ſhould (in all probabilitie) haue retired beyond <hi>Norimberg,</hi> towards the bancks of the Riuer <hi>Maine</hi> in <hi>Franconia.</hi> Thereabouts, was the whole Country at his deuotion; and hither, might the ſeuerall Armies which he had now ſent for; with leſſe danger, and more ſpeed, haue marcht vp to him. But either of theſe, had he now done; then, doubtleſſe, would <hi>Walenſtein</hi> ſo ſtrongly haue entrencht
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18715:7"/> himſelfe before <hi>Norimberg</hi> in the meane time, that there would haue beene no remoouing of him.</p>
                  <p>Seuerall Chieftaines with their Armies,<note place="margin">The King ſends for his ſeuerall Armies to come to him.</note> had the King now abroad, vpon their employments. Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar,</hi> was towards the Riuer <hi>Weſer</hi> about <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> The Landtgraue of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> about <hi>Paderborn,</hi> and the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of <hi>Cullen:</hi> The <hi>Rex-Chancellor Oxenſtiern,</hi> about <hi>Mentz;</hi> and Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> with the Generall <hi>Banier,</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaria.</hi> All theſe Armies, he had at his firſt encamping, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with all ſpeed to come and ioyne with him: which whileſt they are about to doe; we ſhall entertaine our Readers with the chiefeſt of thoſe military diſcourſes, deſcriptions, and rencounters: which paſſed betwixt the two Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Norimberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Begin we with the Kings Leaguer, and the deſcription of it, as alſo of the ſtrength he had to lay in it. He had, at his firſt ſitting downe, ſixe <hi>Brigades</hi> of foote forces: three where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were commanded by <hi>Graue Neeles;</hi> and the other three, by Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn;</hi> which came to betwixt ſeuen and 8000,<note place="margin">The Kings ſtrength,</note> and no more. About that ſtrength, were his Horſe: not full 8000 compleat, and yet faſt vpon it. The Right wing of theſe horſe, was commanded by Lieftenant Generall <hi>Strieff,</hi> and the left-wing, by Leiftenant Generall <hi>Goldſtein.</hi> His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, conſiſted of twenty Peeces of battery; and thirty Fielding Peeces, of three and ſixe pound ball. The King, ſo ſoone as euer he had taken the reſolution of retyring to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg:</hi> had ſent before hand to the Towne, to haue his Leaguer prouided for him about the City. Himſelfe with his Army, ſtaid two dayes in the Mountaines, whileſt his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be ſomething towards a readineſſe: ſo that at his firſt comming, he found the Trenches halfe wrought by the Burgers. They were found too little, when the King came to lodge his Army in them: for which cauſe, his Maieſty in perſon rode round about the Towne to lay out the ground for enlarging of the Quarters:<note place="margin">with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his Leaguer.</note> which contained 35000 Rods of ground, within the vttermoſt <hi>line</hi> of <hi>Circumualla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:18715:8"/> And for my underſtanding of this ſtrength and Leaguer; are the thanks due unto the Noble and valiant Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The faſhion of the Citie of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> enclines, moſtly, to a circle; and yet ſomething to an ovall figure. The ſmall river <hi>Pegnitz,</hi> runnes in at the Eaſt, and out at the Weſt of it. It hath many faire Suburbs; and in them, was the Kings Leaguer: it embracing both Towne and Suburbs, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, within the compaſſe of its protection. I begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Fortifications vpon the Eaſt ſide, by the river, and the Suburb of <hi>Weert.</hi> Hence, all about the hill of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> vnto S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohns;</hi> was it taken vp with diuers <hi>Baſtions,</hi> and <hi>Retrenchments:</hi> all theſe, being guarded by their <hi>Flanckers,</hi> and other ordinary <hi>Defences.</hi> On the other ſide of the water, was the <hi>Pent</hi> encompaſſed about with another <hi>Fort</hi> or <hi>Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> which being well Flanckered with a <hi>Curtaine:</hi> was alſo joyned unto a Fort new builded in the Suburbe called <hi>Gaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoff:</hi> and that well defended likewiſe with diuers <hi>Halfe-Moones</hi> and <hi>Horn-works.</hi> The Suburb called <hi>Steinbuhel</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Scheinaw;</hi> was ſtrongly entrenched likewiſe; guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beſides with two other <hi>Forts,</hi> joyning one upon another. Towards the wood of <hi>Rotenbach,</hi> was there a <hi>Fort-royall</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: and another towards <hi>Gleiſhammer,</hi> upon the way that leadeth towards <hi>Altorff.</hi> Divers <hi>Batteryes</hi> were erected here and there, betweene: which were plentifully furniſhed with the Kings owne Ordnance; and others out of the Towne <hi>Magazine.</hi> The <hi>Works</hi> were ſtrongeſt, upon the South ſide; for that the King ſuſpected the enemy likelyeſt to encampe there: and upon the Eaſt ſide, towards the Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Palatinate;</hi> for feare the Imperialiſts ſhould haue had the courage to have falne on upon the neereſt ſide to them, at their firſt comming. The <hi>Moate</hi> or <hi>Graff</hi> round about all, was, generally twelue foot wide, and eight deepe: and about the <hi>Head-works,</hi> eighteene foot wide, and twelue deepe. The King of <hi>Bohemia's</hi> Quarter in the Leaguer, was at <hi>Weiershaus,</hi> (a houſe of one <hi>Weier,</hi> a Burger) on the South
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18715:8"/> ſide of the Citie, and in the way towards <hi>Newmarckt.</hi> Eight thouſand ſouldiers laboured daily upon the Fortifications: the <hi>Works</hi> being not yet fully perfected, at <hi>Walenſteins</hi> firſt comming: ſo that the King looked preſently to haue beene aſſaulted. But our <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> in the point of fighting, deceiued the expectations both of his friends, and of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>And this is ſomething towards the deſcription of the Kings Leaguer. And here was his Majeſty now reſolued to abide that ſhocke and tempeſt of warre; which from the whole power of the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>houſe of Auſtria;</hi> hee had laſt ſpring expected ſhould at <hi>Mentz</hi> haue falne upon him. At <hi>Mentz,</hi> therefore, did he laſt yeere make thoſe ſo large Fortifications and Bridges; which Page 51 of our <hi>Second Part</hi> you ſhall finde deſcribed. There had hee taken in the hils about the Towne; not ſo much to make the Citie ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (which plainly, hee did not) but to have a Camping-place for the lodging of ſuch an Army; as might beare the brunt of the whole power of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>Doe we now as much for their Highneſſes the Dukes of <hi>Fridland</hi> and <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The Army was much about the ſame number that we haue before ſet you downe, Page 233 of our <hi>Second Part.</hi> For in the end of this <hi>Iuly,</hi> that they encampt in; <hi>Walenſtein</hi> himſelfe ſent a <hi>Liſt</hi> of his whole Forces, unto his Imperiall Majeſty at <hi>Vienna.</hi> In it, were 191 Cornets of Horſe beſides <hi>Crabats</hi> and <hi>Dragooners:</hi> with 149 Foot Companies. The Horſe, at 125 to a Cornett (which is the uſuall proportion) amount to about 20000: And ſo many <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe he had indeed. His Foot, at 300 complete,<note place="margin">The Forces of <hi>Walenſtein</hi> and <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                     </note> to a company for halfe of them (for ſo <hi>Walſteins Liſt,</hi> was) and the reſt, as ſtrong as the Captaines could make them; amount to 40000: and ſo many marching men they had <hi>effective:</hi> (tis the word of the forenamed Gentleman) who accounted themſelues 80000. The <hi>Crabats</hi> were full 5000 men, who gaue out themſelues to be 8000. And this was their whole ſtrength (and with the leaſt too) 40000 Foot, and 25000
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18715:9"/> Horſe: in all 65000. fighting men: who either for their owne credits, were apt to beleeue it, or for policy and terror helpt to giue it out, That they were 128000.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And their great Officers.</note>Theſe were <hi>Walenſteins</hi> great Officers. In his Campe was <hi>Gallas,</hi> (an <hi>Italian</hi> of <hi>Friuli,</hi> and a braue Gentleman) Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Generall; and he gaue out the orders. In the Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi> Campe, had <hi>Altringer</hi> the ſame office: who yet was to be directed and controlled by <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> himſelfe (many times) knowing nothing, till the command was to be executed. <hi>Major-Generall</hi> of the Horſe unto <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> was Colonell <hi>Holck;</hi> a <hi>Holſteyner,</hi> as I take it. His <hi>Generall-Major</hi> of the Foote, was the Colonel <hi>Sparre,</hi> a little blacke Gentleman, and a <hi>Pomerlander.</hi> The valiant Baron of <hi>Cronenberg</hi> (as I take it) was <hi>Generall-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> of the Horſe unto <hi>Bavaria,</hi> but who was of his Foote, I know not: <hi>Cratz</hi> was not now in the Leaguer; for he was yet buſie againſt <hi>Banier,</hi> in <hi>Bavaria:</hi> and he afterwerwards offered to hinder him, when hee came towards <hi>Norimberg.</hi> But this I haue but by heare-ſay. Other great Commanders, which had ſeuerally entrenched Quarters, in the Leaguer, were Count <hi>Maximilian Walſtein,</hi> and Count <hi>Bernard Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein;</hi> Kinſmen, I ſuppoſe, unto the <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi> The Baron of <hi>Schemberg,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Picolomini,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: with <hi>Mittscha</hi> and <hi>Gratzij,</hi> Colonells Generall of the <hi>Crabats</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> in their Quarter. <hi>Walenſtein</hi> at his firſt comming, ſate downe a night or two about <hi>Schwabach,</hi> untill his Quarters could be made ready for him: which done, then went he and ſate downe in his Leaguer.</p>
                  <p>The whole Imperiall Leaguer, was at firſt diuided into 8. ſeuerall Quarters: if the <hi>Figure</hi> cut in Copper be true, which I haue ſeene printed, with a <hi>High Dutch</hi> deſcription, to it.

The ſeuenth, was by <hi>Prentzengart;</hi> betwixt the High-waies that leade to <hi>Amberg,</hi> and to <hi>Culmbach:</hi> on the North-Eaſt of <hi>Norimberg:</hi> This was the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and the <hi>Crabats</hi> Quarter: whoſe chiefes were <hi>Iſolani, Mittscha</hi> and <hi>Gratzij.</hi> The 8. and laſt Quarter, was by <hi>Rehenberg;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the wayes to <hi>Culmbach</hi> and <hi>Bamberg,</hi> upon the North of the City; and neere unto the Head-Quarter. This was the Count of <hi>Schombergs.</hi> Betwixt each of theſe, was there Workes and Forts, one or two; according to the diſtance.</p>
                  <p>This mighty Leaguer, was vaſte, rather then accurate: <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> ſurely, was defectiue in this point of military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, he is none of the beſt <hi>Spademen;</hi> nor had he any good Enginiers about him. Seuen of theſe 8. Quarters, were but ſlight ones; a little earth caſt vp, and barricadoed with Wagons, trees and other encumberments. Nor were they cloſe behind: as if out of a military bravery, they would have the King know, they truſted more to their ſtrengths, then to their trenches. Nor did theſe 7. Quarters hold long; but onely till they heard of <hi>Oxenſtierns</hi> comming: againſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18715:10"/> which time, the Head Quarter was enlarged and fortified: and all the forces of the reſt, drawne into it. That we now deſcribe. The <hi>Avenues</hi> or <hi>Paſſages</hi> of this great Leaguer, in and out, thorow the Retrenchments, had <hi>Barricadoes</hi> right before them, made with Truncks and mighty boughes of Trees, among: with broken Wagons, Turne-pikes, Gabions, or Cannon-baskets, peeces of old Cask filld vp with earth and ſtones; and many ſuch other rude deviſes, to blocke up the way withall: eſpecially againſt Horſe, and ſudden <hi>Camiſadoes.</hi> The place for ſome of his Quarters, was a naturall Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hilly, wooddy, and buſhye: and eſpecially by the hill and old Caſtle of <hi>Altendorp;</hi> made famous on Saint <hi>Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes</hi> day following, by a moſt notable conflict for it. All the bridges over the 2. little rivers, had he cauſed to be broken downe: at <hi>Katzwang,</hi> namely, <hi>Reychelſdorff, Stain, Wayker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoff,</hi> and <hi>Furt;</hi> that ſo, no body might, on the ſudden come at him. Divers villages were within theſe <hi>Quarters,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being lodg'd in one of them: yea and <hi>Walenſtein</hi> himſelfe, though he had his day Pavilion in the open field, for the moſt part, and when it was faire weather; yet was his lodging (when he pleaſed) within a houſe. And this was fitteſt both for his diſeaſes and humours: he is ſhrewdly troubled with the Gowte,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Walensteins</hi> diſeaſes.</note> ſo that he goes ſoftly, and is led ſometimes. Some other crazyneſſes, is he likewiſe troubled with, for which the cold earth is not ſo kindly. He loues to keepe a State, fit for the dignity of his place: and that affects priuacy and retyredneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Soveraignty (I muſt not expreſſe it in a lower ſtile) over the <hi>Militia;</hi> was abſolutely, at the Duke of <hi>Fridlands</hi> diſpoſure:<note place="margin">Walensteins</note> for ſo much he tooke vpon him, as <hi>Imperiall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Authority,</note> He was <hi>Fellow in Armes,</hi> and no <hi>Generall,</hi> over the Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> for that his Army, was independant; and he, as a Prince of the Empire by himſelfe, had levied it at his owne charges. Yet did <hi>Walenſtein</hi> commaund all; and that with a <hi>Switch</hi> (as it were:) his <hi>Orders</hi> being giuen out with an <hi>Imperious Eloquence,</hi> which is <hi>Breefeneſſe.</hi> His pleaſure (ſo much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18715:10"/> is due to a Generall) muſt not onely be uncontrolleable, but undiſputable: and he is a moſt ſudden and ſeuere <hi>Iuſticier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Severity,</note> (when he pleaſes) for his <hi>military diſcipline. Hang the beaſt,</hi> (thats his word) that obeyes not with a ſervile celerity.<note place="margin">and Bounty.</note> He is a bountifull-handed man, where he finds deſeruing: and theſe two things, <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> (and enough of both) are the <hi>Secrets</hi> of his <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> theſe are the chiefe lawes that kept his Campe in exceeding good order, all the time of this Leaguer; and himſelfe well beloued of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. There was no great good heartineſſe of affection, (ſome will ſay) betwixt the 2. Dukes: and if <hi>Bavaria,</hi> at any time, interpoſed his counſell; <hi>Walenſtein</hi> would take no more of it, then ſhould ſerue his turne: good aduice, perchance, being now and then diſcountenanced, for the Giver.</p>
                  <p>The Campe being fortified, the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> gave this generall order unto his ſouldiers, that they ſhould make more uſe of their trenches, then of their weapons: That they ſhould not, but with ſpeciall leaue, goe out upon commanded Partees, and that very ſtrongly: That they ſhould not, but upon command, ſtraggle abroad after forrage or adventures: but continue to make good the Poſts, they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, till they were relieved. That they ſhould, for the moſt part, containe themſelues upon the defenſive within their Quarters: and when they were in commanded Partees ſent abroad, they ſhould then hinder the <hi>Swedes</hi> from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forrage. He had taken a very excellent order, for the victualling of his Army; for ſure, the Duke of <hi>Fridlands</hi> Maſter-piece, is to be a good <hi>Proviſioner:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His proviſions for his Army, what.</note> and he hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good <hi>Catering-wit</hi> of his owne. Aboue all, had he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good care for his <hi>Provant-breade,</hi> which is halfe the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diet of a ſouldier: and they will doe well enough, where bread is good, and plentifull. That which moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated him, was, That navigable river, he had none, for the ſeruice of his Leaguer. The river <hi>Rednitz</hi> though it ranne from his Campe, into the Biſhopricke of <hi>Bamberg</hi> (a friends countrey) yet it being both narrow, and ſhallow, and againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18715:11"/> the ſtreame too;<note place="margin">whence, and how, fetched.</note> it was no way capable of any great carriages. His truſt for the bringing of his victualls, therefore, muſt be by Convoyes over land: which were farre more caſuall, and more chargeable. He had laid all the countrey for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Divers troopes of his Cavallery, were ſent unto all the next greater townes and Paſſages, then at his devotion: which were there to hold their Quarters. As to <hi>Cronach,</hi> namely, and <hi>Forcheim,</hi> in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Bamberg: Wills<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Weiſſenburg,</hi> an Imperiall towne by it, in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Aichſtet.</hi> Some of his Forces had beene left beyond <hi>Norimberg</hi> in the <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi>) was his Campe ſerved with proviſions, and the Kings Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer thereby cut off, from all neceſſaries: Every day were ſtrong commanded Horſe-Partees ſent abroad, to lye upon ſeverall Poſts and Paſſages of advantage, to intercept the Kings Foragers. This was commonly the <hi>Crabats</hi> buſineſſe: who lay up and downe, 4. 6. 8. or 10. miles from the Kings Leaguer. With theſe had the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Partees their moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; but for brevities ſake I muſt not inſiſt upon every skirmiſh.</p>
                  <p>All this, was done by <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> with Iudgement, and like a Generall: and this was all the force he uſed to conſtreine the King, to diſlodge from before <hi>Norimberg,</hi> and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it up to his mercy.<note place="margin">

He ſaw the Kings Works and Retrenchments, to be made ſo ſtrong, that it would prooue a deſperate peece of ſeruice, for whoſoeuer ſhould undertake to aſſault them. And <hi>Walenſtein</hi> boldly gaue it out, <hi>That it ſorted not with the Service of His
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18715:11"/> Imperiall Majeſtie to haue the new Army hazarded, upon a Battell or Invaſion: That there had beene too much attempted that way, before; and That he would ſhow the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>another kinde of Warre-faring.</hi> And thus much indeed, was by ſome priſoners of great note, confeſſed unto the King, afterwards: namely, that the Imperiall <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> had this plot upon him. To draw the Warre out into a length; and to awayte the favour of opportunitie: hoping, at laſt, to ſerve himſelfe ſo well, upon the Kings neceſſities; that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhould ſo conſtreine him; or his friends ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with him; that he ſhould, if not offer, yet not deny, to hearken; unto a good Treaty. This if it tooke well, then ſhould the advantage, in the concluſion of the Peace, make him a faire ſaver for his patience; preſerve Him a gallant Army, to be otherwhere employed for His Imperiall Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: and gaine, finally, a moſt ample reputation unto the name of <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> as one that had onely knowne, how to handle the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Walenſteins</hi> Reſt up, and he was reſolved to act no part but of <hi>Fabius:</hi> hee had the King in a coope, or in a toyle already, and there (for a while) hee meant to keepe him, and <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Something, indeed, his Army did, at their very firſt comming into thoſe Quarters:<note place="margin">

Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foraging voyages they alſo made upon the Boores barnes and houſes; in the ſmaller townes of the neighbour Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate of <hi>Onſpach;</hi> (commonly called <hi>The Lower Marquiſate</hi>) and into the Iuriſdiction of the <hi>Norimbergers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey abroad.</note> The poore towne of <hi>Swabach</hi> (8 or 9 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Norimberg</hi>) now falling into the Lordly diſpleaſure of the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> (for that it had ſlaine 50 of his men, in the taking of it) was by him deſtinated unto an univerſall deſtruction.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18715:12"/> and the puniſhment commuted to a ranſome: as a ſurety for which moneyes, the chiefe Magiſtrate was carryed away priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Divers able troopes, were by our <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> (at his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt ſetting downe) diſpatched further into the Marquiſate of <hi>Onſpach,</hi> and the Dukedome of <hi>Franconia.</hi> Neere <hi>Onſpach,</hi> was the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Liechtenaw</hi> within the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Norimbergers,</hi> preſſed, but not taken yet, by the <hi>Walſteiners.</hi> Three of their Regiments attempted an Aenſlaught upon the Imperiall Citie of <hi>Winſhaim</hi> upon the river <hi>Aiſch,</hi> 30 Engliſh miles to the Weſt of <hi>Norimberg:</hi> and 24 to the Northweſt of <hi>Onſpach.</hi> But this deſigne of theirs being diſcovered and defeated by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> garriſon, and the Burgers; the Imperialiſts gate a ſhrewd bruſh here, left many of their fellowes behind them, and carryed off the beſt part of 1000 more, wounded with them into <hi>Swabach.</hi> They rambled up and downe as farre as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ffenhaim</hi> alſo, eight miles more to the Weſtward. <hi>Kitzingen,</hi> and <hi>Swinfort</hi> both, were in ſome dread of them: but that the river <hi>Mayn</hi> was a good Barricadoe betwixt them and the preſent danger. All that countrey likewiſe, which you ſee bounded with that mightie compaſſe of the river <hi>Mayne,</hi> to the Northward; even from <hi>Bamberg,</hi> unto this <hi>Kitzingen,</hi> was daily ouer-run and brought under contribution by their Horſe-Partees. On the Northern ſide of the <hi>Mayne</hi> alſo, thoſe <hi>Crabats</hi> that had their Quarters in and about <hi>Bamberg,</hi> did at pleaſure roave up and downe the countrey, euen unto the very walles of <hi>Wurtsburg.</hi> Due South of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> moreover, even as farre as the Biſhopricke of <hi>Aichſtet,</hi> for above 30 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles together, was all at their devotion; and did daily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Imperiall Leaguer with proviſions. The <hi>Crabats</hi> (who are the ranke-ryders, and common harryers of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Army) had by this time plundered <hi>Hippolſtein,</hi> a pretty Towne betwixt <hi>Norimberg</hi> and <hi>Aichſtet.</hi> Having lodged there a-while, they ſet it on fire at parting: barbarouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough laughing at the poore mens miſeries, <hi>That they never
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18715:12"/> uſed to pay their Hoſts, in other money.</hi> The Townes of <hi>Carelſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and <hi>Roſtall</hi> on the Weſt of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> were alſo ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: None faring ſo well, as thoſe that worſt uſed them; and that had the courage to let flye their Ordnance amongſt them. And thus farre was our <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> abſolute Maſter of the Field: excepting thoſe good Townes onely, which had <hi>Swediſh</hi> garriſons in them. All this was done by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1632. and now turne wee backe againe unto <hi>Norimberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We told you before, of the good order taken by <hi>Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> for the victualing of his Army: which for all his care, muſt be contented with the entertainment of the Warres, and with many an <hi>Italian</hi> dinner. The <hi>Generaliſſimo's</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dyet, was ſixe diſhes a meale, and two bottles of wine to it, as long as it laſted. The Kings table, perchance, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better ſerv'd; as relying wholly upon the Magazine of <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Hence (as I find it from ſeverall hands aſſured,) was his Campe furniſhed with 8000 pound of bread (80000 ſome name) daily. The <hi>Norimbergers</hi> wanted Milles, rather then come: which the enemy had burnt downe. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were faine to Steward their proviſions, as thriftily as they could: <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> that he might haue enough to ſtarve the King withall: and the King, to be able to hold out, till his ſureties, thoſe other Armies which he had now ſent for ſhould be comne up to baile him. That which moſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated both the Armies, was want of ſtraw and Horſe-meate: for which, whiles both ſides ſent out a foraging, there fell out many a ſhrewd bickering betweene them: one ſide carrying away oftentimes, what the others had before mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Walenſtein</hi> kept his Army all this while, under very good diſcipline; nor durſt he leave them any more at large, unto the libertie of that former licentiouſneſſe which in other Warres, they had beene let looſe unto. He very well knew, how neere he now was, unto a King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> who ſtill, as any of the Imperialiſts durſt venture abroad a Boot-haling; had ever ſome Partee or other, upon the the powles of them.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18715:13"/> And in the ſame manner were the <hi>Swedes</hi> alſo ſerved: both ſides taking their turnes, according to advantage. The firſt Warre that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> now made with the King, was a contention of courteſie: for the man (certainly) is a gallant ſpirited perſonage, and full of nobleneſſe. Hee firſt of all, and without ranſome,) ſent him home his well eſteemed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Dubatell:</hi> whom, (as in the latter end of our <hi>Second Part</hi> we told you) he had lately taken priſoner about <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marckt.</hi> With him, ſent he the King this complement: <hi>That he had no other ambition,</hi>

Oh, that you cannot conſider with your ſelves, what a fearefull account you are to yeeld up to God, at that great and moſt dreadfull Audite. And for mine owne part; rather would I have ſtill remained in mine owne kingdome, then have comne hither to behold theſe inſolencies.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, perchance, That you want moneyes. But when I have the meanes to ſatisfie both you and the whole Army; and you by pillaging, robbing, and plundering, ſhall deprive mee of theſe meanes: where, I beſeech you, is the fault, that you are not ſatisfied? What ſhare have I at any

I doe proteſt before God, and it is moſt true that I ſay, that I have not by all this War ſo much enriched my ſelfe, as a paire of Bootes come to: and I profeſſe withall, that I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ryde without Bootes, then any wayes, or in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, make my ſelfe the richer, by the damage or undoing of theſe poore people. I will make it appeare to you, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is deſirous therein to be ſatisfied; That ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of mine owne kingdome, at 32 ſeverall returnes, I have had full 40 tunnes of gold, made over to mee: all which, I have ſpent for your good, and for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Princes, as are united with mee, in the ſame truth of Religion.<note place="margin">The eighth of this moneth, he gave his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a moneths meanes, out of the moneyes then borrowed of the <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergers</hi> at ſixe in the hundred.</note> I might, I confeſſe, have herein beene ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but the remembrance of that great loſſe, which by the deaths of ſo many brave Worthies and Cavaliers, (whoſe vertues, indeed, were beyond all eſtimation) I account my ſelfe to have ſuſtained, even conſtrained me to utter what I doe: for, truely, I ever valewed them, beyond all my riches. And you for your parts; what have you contributed towards all theſe Warres? This is all, that henceforth I ſhall deſire at your hands, That you ſpoile not others of their goods, but leave every man unto his owne poſſeſſions. The choler and manhood that you have, skore it (a Gods name) upon the fronts of your enemies; but diſtaine not the honour of a ſouldiour, by inſulting upon unarmed innocents. Live upon your meanes, like ſouldiours, and not upon pilfering, and ſpoyling, like high-way-robbers. This if you doe not, you ſhall ever be infamous, and I by ſuch helpers, never become victorious.</p>
                  <p>Piouſly ſpoken, and like a King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> like <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> who had the <hi>Religion</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the <hi>equity</hi> of a <hi>Lord Chiefe Iustice</hi> in him.

This prohibition was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by ſound of trumpet Proclaimed; but to ſhow how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere he meant to be in his executions; he cauſes a Leiftenant to be hanged, for committing ſome of theſe aforeſaid inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. When alſo a Boore having complained of a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour for ſtealing his Cowe from him, there was meanes made to ſave the delinquent; <hi>My</hi> ſonne, ſayes the King to him, it is better that I ſhould now puniſh thee, then that the wrath of God, for thy miſdeeds, and his Iudgements, ſhould fall downe upon <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>thee,</hi> and upon all of us here preſent.</p>

                     </note> that other writings make no mention of it. Now were <hi>Banier</hi> and Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> within 30.

But this they durſt not venture: for beſides that they were not ſtrong enough, to have marched thorow the countrey, every where infeſted with the <hi>Walſteiners;</hi> they had beene farre to weake, too have paſſed by his great leaguer.

                  <p>With <hi>Baniers</hi> Army, came there a noble young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our Nation, Maſter <hi>William Harvey</hi> onely ſonne to the Lord <hi>Harvey;</hi> who now vpon his returne from a three yeeres travell, in <hi>Ieruſalem, Conſtantinople, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. meeting with the Armies: had a generous ambition to ſee the action at <hi>Norimberg:</hi> where he heard ſo famous a King to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>

                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. they advance to <hi>Bruck,</hi> 10. miles North of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg:</hi> where the ſmall river <hi>Aurach,</hi> falls into the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz.</hi> On the Weſterne ſide of which river, (the towne ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Eaſt) the Armies entrench for 2. or 3. daies: building up Batteries and Redoubts, in this neereneſſe of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18715:23"/> enemy. Hither, came the King himſelfe, and overviewed the Armie, as it was drawne up into <hi>Battaglia,</hi> which he found to be 26000. marching men, all freſh and luſty. They were 12. <hi>Brigades</hi> of Foote, beſides commanded Muskettiers: but of the Horſe I have no certaintie. The Imperialiſts hauing here broken downe the bridge, the King cauſeth it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired: over which, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 20. in the euening, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched: entrenching the ſame night before <hi>Bruck.</hi> Now were 3.

                  <p>A ſolemne day of praier being had in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Leaguer, for the happy ioyning, and good ſucceſſe of the Armies: the King quitting his Trenches about <hi>Norimberg,</hi> came the 21.<note place="margin">Altogether ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the King, before <hi>Walensteins</hi> Trenches.</note> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to meete the Chancellors Army; they likewiſe advancing to meete him: ioyned both Armies together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 12. or one a clocke the ſelfe ſame Tueſday. All then being drawne up into <hi>Battaglia,</hi> before the enemies Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſtood there all that day, to make a Brave upon him.</p>
                  <p>And thus haue I concluded this long digreſſion, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of all the Kings forces to him: which if the Readers cenſure, for too long an interuption from the Kings Storie; I muſt, in ſtead of anſwering, craue a faire pardon of them. And yet to ſay ſomething towards a Reaſon. Beſides that it had beene pitty to have loſt all their Stories: I knew not on the ſudden, how to drop all theſe Armies, out of the cloudes into the Kings Leaguer; nor how, bluntly, and all at once; to ſhoote them in an Engine, as farre as <hi>Norimberg:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I brought them, faire and ſoftly, upon their feete all the way, out of their ſeverall Stations.</p>
                  <p>Now was the King reſolued, to bring the whole cauſe, to a day of hearing: and that as loud, as the Cannons could roare it. He was now full 36000. men in field; though not all then in <hi>Battaglia.</hi> The King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> (by this time
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18715:24"/> well recovered of his Leaguer-ſickneſſe) was in the field with him:<note place="margin">The fight deſcribed Auguſt 21.</note> both the Kings being deſirous to tempt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of his Campe, into faire Campagnia; fully purpoſed, if that offer were refuſed, to ſet upon him in his Trenches. And ſo might they if they pleaſed: <hi>Walenſtein</hi> would not budge a foote, out of his Quarters. On the <hi>Norimberg</hi> ſide of his Trenches, therefore, the King caſts up three great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; and from thence plaid inceſſantly into <hi>Walenſteins,</hi> Quarters: he thundering as furiouſly upon them againe. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Muskettiers going neerer the Trenches; were with ſmall ſhot anſwered from them againe: but neither ſmall nor great ſhot, did much harme upon one another; ſauing onely that Generall <hi>Banier,</hi> going too neere to view a worke; received a Musket bullet in the left arme above the elbow, where it was left ſticking.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the King cauſed ſome greater peeces of Ordnance to be mounted upon his Batteries: ſome of which, ſhot 21.<note place="margin">Auguſt 22.</note> pound ball, and ſome 42. <hi>Walenſtein</hi> anſwering with ſome, that ſhot 48. Theſe roared upon one another for a great time together: but the Kings plainely, did little ſpoile upon the enemies. The <hi>Walſteiners</hi> wiſely withdrew themſelues, out the <hi>beate</hi> and <hi>raking</hi> of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ordnance: which were (after the making of 700. ſhot) perceived, to doe more execution on the earth and trees, then upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Now was it with perſpective glaſſes to be diſcerned, from off the Kings Batteries; that there was ſcarce a <hi>Walſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> to be ſeene ſtirring: For this reaſon: the King cauſeth his Ordnance to be diſmounted: not willing to ſmoake away ſo much powder in ſquibs; nor to doe no more then plowe vp the ground, with the grazing of ſo many bullets, of that weight and height; meerely ſhot off at an empty randome, Yet one ſhot let me not omit, becauſe the King made it. The King (as tis written) ſpying in the morning, with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue from one of his Batteries, a gallant Cavalier moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prancing before his Companies: that ſurely (ſaith the King) ſhould be either <hi>Walenſtein</hi> or <hi>Altringer;</hi> and have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18715:24"/> at him. Cauſing therefore a peece to be traverſed and bent full upon him; the King tooke his levell, and bade <hi>giue fire</hi> to it. Vp into the aire flew the Cavalier, horſe and man: but it proved to be but a Colonell.</p>
                  <p>The King having diſmounted his owne Cannon, and given order to haue the <hi>Norimbergers</hi> drawne out into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about the Towne; he that day and the next, paſſes the moſt part of his Army over the river <hi>Rednitz,</hi> a little aboue <hi>Furt,</hi> before named. His purpoſe in it was, to poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of a certaine hill thereby: by advantage whereof hee hoped aſſuredly either to batter out, or beate out, the enemy from his Quarters. This done, the 24. of our Auguſt (being Saint <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> day) was reſolued upon for the generall onſet. The ſame 23. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> fell there out a skirmiſh on the further ſide of the <hi>Rednitz,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Crabats</hi> and the Kings people: at which, whileſt, amongſt other Gentlemen Maſter <hi>William Harvey</hi> (before named) was deſirous to be preſent; he was moſt unfortunately drowned, in paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the river. A Gentleman he was, who might one day haue merited a place in our owne <hi>Chronicles;</hi> for few young Sparkes were there among the Nobility of any Nation; either finelier made up, more gentilely bred, or more completely improued. Nor is this more then a moderate <hi>Laudative</hi> of him; for ſo ſay they, that could iudge him: very great therefore is the loſſe of ſuch a Sonne, to his honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but greater will be the want of ſuch as he, to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walenſtein</hi> perceiuing the Kings intention, he the better to aſſure his Cannon and Ammunition; retired himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Foreſt called <hi>Altemberg:</hi> which belongeth unto the Marqueſſe of <hi>Onſpach.</hi> Here could he make uſe, likewiſe, of a certaine old Fortreſſe; which had beene a Lodge, (or ſome ſuch like thing) in the younger dayes of it. Here, likewiſe, did he very ſtrongly entrench himſelfe; and barricadoed up all the wayes, by cutting downe the trees round about him. The hill was high, and very ſteepe: craggie withall, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18715:25"/> buſhie; ſo that it was an impoſſible thing (almoſt) to be taken from an enemy, that had any courage to diſpute it. The Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi> Quarters (as it hapned) were at that time neereſt to the King and the danger: and among his men, the Canon bullets moſtly lighted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The great fight Auguſt 24.</note>
                     <hi>Bartholmew</hi> day being comne; the worke was begun with <hi>Prayers;</hi> for the happy ſucceſſe of it. So the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſtill uſed: nor thought he himſelfe either <hi>arm'd</hi> or <hi>valiant;</hi> till he had prayed. That morning, about nine a clocke; was there a certaine Footman or Lackey of <hi>Altringers,</hi> brought priſoner to the King: who, (as by pregnant circumſtances was afterwards collected) had beene purpoſely expoſed by the enemy, to be taken priſoner by us. This ſlye fellow very confidently informed the King; How that the moſt part of <hi>Walenſteins</hi> Horſe, had already forſaken their Quarters, and were about to runne quite away from the leaguer. The King indeed, from this higher ground, ſaw the Army in motion: but it was not to runne away from their Colours, but with all ſpeed to poſſeſſe themſelues of the little mountaine and old Caſtle, and another Fort upon it: which it had beene eaſie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe for the King to have taken, and from thence to have beaten <hi>Bavaria,</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> out of their Leaguers.</p>
                  <p>The King by and by perceiving their intention, and againe obſerving the great advantage of the place: reſolved, (which ſome thinke he had not, untill this newes of <hi>Altringers</hi> Footman) that notwithſtanding the enemy had prevented him in it; and had now made the action more deſperate: yet that it muſt immediately be ſet upon. Putting his Army, therefore, into Battaglia, (as well as the place would giue leaue) the King himſelfe led on the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ant-guard</hi> of the left Wing: Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar</hi> had the honour of the Battell, to cloaſe up the Kings right hand: and Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> with the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> brought up the Reere. Some of theſe troopes, were ſent to fall on upon that ruinous old Caſtle of <hi>Altemberg,</hi> on the hill aforeſaid.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18715:25"/> The other part, were ſtill left at the bottome of the Hill, and upon the ſides of it: to lye in ambuſh amongſt the trees and buſhes there, to keepe off the Aides and Seconds of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and to ſhrowd themſelues withall, from the fury of the enemies Canon. This place alſo ſerved for a Retreat unto their fellowes, ſhould they chance to be overlayed: the men, beſides, being there neere at hand, to be ſent for upon occaſion. The place, indeed, was naturally fit for ſuch a purpoſe: for it was a hollow over-hanging in the hils ſide; where they lay in Covert from any offence of the enemy. The order of the Aſſault was to this purpoſe: Euery Colonel and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was aſſigned to his Poſt; 500. men were ordered to fall on: which were every two houres releeued, with freſh Seconds. Theſe were commanded Muskettiers all; drawne out of the ſeverall <hi>Brigades:</hi> and the Colours ſtaid with the reſt, below the mountaine.</p>
                  <p>And now began the conflict, for the winning and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that old Caſtle; which proved a medlye of 10. houres long, on both ſides. Many a brave Gentleman, here loſt his life; many a Cavalier was here wounded: and not a few taken priſoners. The King led on his men, with his ſword drawne in his hand: and the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> as if to ſhow the enemy how little they dreaded any thing, that they could doe unto them; and how much they deſpiſed danger: expoſed themſelues all naked unto the enemies ſhot; having not ſo much as any one Trench or Earth caſt up, to ſhelter them. In this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, runne they cloſe unto the enemies Works and Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: ſtoutly and manfully, fall they on upon them: and with the courage of undaunted ſpirits, doe they ruſh into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But the Imperialiſts as full of reſolution, made a moſt ſtout reſiſtance unto the <hi>Swediſh.</hi> For having the advantage, both of the higher ground, of their owne Trenches and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries already before hand there caſt up: and having the wals of the old Caſtle to retreate unto, and to ſhelter their freſh ſupplies in: they maintained it with extremity of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The naturall high ſtanding of the place, gave them all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18715:26"/> the advantages, that the providence of an enemy could have fore-thought of. Thence directed they their peeces with more aime and certainty, thence fell the Partiſans which they darted, with more weight upon the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their owne <hi>Parapets</hi> they ſtood more then halfe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe on the lower ground: ſo that more of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> bullets, light upon the Imperialiſts <hi>Breſt-works</hi> then into their <hi>Breasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe inconveniences, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> continued deſperate, and the Imperialiſts as obſtinate. The Cannons and Muskets went off all day long, inceſſantly: ſo that nothing was to be ſeene upon the Mountaine, but flame and ſmoake: and for the roaring of the Ordnance, the skrikes and groanings of wounded and dying men, could hardly be diſcerned. All this was performed with ſo much terror and fury, and on both ſides maintained with ſo much obſtinacy; that (conſidering the diſadvantages on the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide) the Battell of <hi>Prague</hi> or <hi>Leipſich,</hi> was not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it. Regiment attacked Regiment, one Enſigne conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued flying againſt another: untill the greater part of the Foote on both ſides, were thorowly engaged in the medlye. The Imperialiſts had 6000. men, then upon the Hill; for the guard of it, and of the old Caſtle: thoſe, ſtill ſupplyed from the Campe: and all, ſo fenced with a <hi>Brest-worke</hi> behind which they ſtood to ſhoote downe, that nothing but their heads could be ſeene over it. Thus at length, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no good to be done upon it: were enforced to quit the danger; the moſt of them withdrawing themſelves, unto the foote of the Mountaine. The Cannon continued their vollyes above, ſtill; and ſome Muskettiers were there left, to maintaine the skirmiſh.</p>
                  <p>In this attempt upon the hill, whereas the King and Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> had fallen on upon ſeverall places of it: it chanced that Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> proved farre the more convenient: and that he had gotten the height of the enemies Campe, and could ſee downe into it. He ſending the King word of it, the King
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18715:26"/> diſpatched backe Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> to him, to take, and bring a view of it. Whileſt Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> were at their view, there was a Ritt-maſter ſhot dead, hard by them: which ſhowed, that the place was not altogether ſo ſafe, as was hoped. Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried the King word, and that it was much the better place; his Maieſtie himſelfe came to ſee it. Which done, you have reaſon (ſaies he to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>) for what you ſay: but yet if I giue on here, I muſt doe it with my groſſe of Foote; whereby I ſhall leaue my Horſe and my Cannon naked: and the enemy, withall, may then chooſe where he will fight with me; either in this or that place, or in both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as he pleaſes. This paſſage, I learned from the right valiant Knight, here mentioned: and that the preſentneſſe of the Kings iudgement, was approoued in it. And this I adde of my ſelfe; ſomething to controll the rumor of it that ranne over <hi>Germany,</hi> that if the King would but haue deſcended from his obſtinacy, and thought it no diſhonour to giue over at the t'other Poſt, and to follow Duke <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> counſell; that the action had beene ended, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my diſlodged.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the <hi>Swedes</hi> being comne downe to the plaine (as is aforeſaid) there beganne another encounter. The enemies Curiaſſiers then iſſuing out upon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Muskettiers, did ſo much there overlay them; that they forced them to give ground from them. Colonell <hi>Tortenſon,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Erich-Hand;</hi> being to maintaine this Poſt; were both here taken; and the latter wounded, by the Curiaſſiers; whileſt they bravely endeavoured to make their Muskettiers to give on againe, upon the enemy. The valiant Baron of <hi>Cronenberg</hi> with his Regiment of 12. Cornets of Horſe (eſteemed the flower of the Army) at this time, falling out, was rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by Colonel<note n="*" place="margin">This Colonel <hi>Stolhanſhe,</hi> (a <hi>Finlander</hi> by nation) was ſometimes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant vnto Sir <hi>Patrick Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> and he ſpeakes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Stolhanſhe</hi> with 200. of his <hi>Finniſh</hi> Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: who ſo well entertained the <hi>Cronbergers,</hi> that they put them to the rowte: yea and ſo farre purſued them, till they came under the command of the Shot from the enemies ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18715:27"/> and that other troopes of freſh Horſe, ſallyed out upon them. It was beleeved among the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> that <hi>Cronenberg</hi> was there mortally wounded: but beſides, that I have ſince read of him in other actions: he was ſeene by ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our owne Nation in the Imperiall Leaguer, a day or two after.</p>
                  <p>It hath by others beene related to mee, That whereas the Count of <hi>Erpach</hi> (a Colonell of the Kings) was that day mortally wounded upon the place, and carryed off ſpoyled; the King meeting Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> in the Field; deſired him to make good the Count of <hi>Erpachs</hi> Poſt; which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>The night beginning now to approach, muſt of neceſſitie put an end to that skirmiſh: and yet it appeared by the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> that they had not yet enough of it. Still they continued to ply their ſmall and great ſhot, and to offer to skale the mountaine, and rampiers of the enemies. The ſame reſoluteneſſe, was alſo maintained by the Imperialiſts: the defendants budging not a foot from their Stations, and nothing behind hand with the Aſſaylants. But that great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator and Stickler in all long encounters, (the Night) was faine at laſt to decide the controverſie. And ſo began both ſides, to fall off one from another, having loſt their ſights, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their courages. And thus was there a <hi>true drawne Battell</hi> made of it: for the darkneſſe being but a blind <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire,</hi> could not ſee to which party, to aſſigne the Victory. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> indeed, loſt their <hi>hopes;</hi> and the Imperialiſts kept their ground. The <hi>Swediſh,</hi> for all their magnanimous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, could not drive the Imperialiſts to the retreat; or beate up their Quarters: nor could they, much leſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Kings forces to give it over. The Horſe, (except, ſome few troopes) could not come to fight; the wood and hill not ſuffering them to encounter: which had they done, needs muſt the buſineſſe have had a further progreſſe.</p>
                  <p>The whole night after, did thoſe Muskettiers that were left upon the hill, continue to giue fire upon thoſe that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18715:27"/> the old Caſtle. It prooved a very wet night: and the King lay in his Coach, under heavens open Canopy. There was a fire made hard by him, upon the wet earth; (which the raine ſuffered not well to burne) about which the Kings ſervants and officers tooke up ſouldiours lodgings: Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> being alſo laid amongſt them. The King by breake of day wakening, (and being very cold and wet) called unto his ſervants, to know if there were any of his Officers of the Field amongſt them. They told him none but Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburne;</hi> who was but a Voluntier at that preſent. Him, now, the King deſired to goe to thoſe Muskettiers on the hill, and to view their poſture: and to ſee, withall, whither there might be any neere place diſcovered, where there might be Ordnance planted to batter upon the old Caſtle. He going, found how theſe poore ſoules, lay all open to the enemies ſhot, from the waſt upwards; and that the Imperialiſts had two places of Covert, one above another, for their ſhelter: that is to ſay, one above, upon the hill; and another <hi>Parapett</hi> or <hi>Breſt-worke,</hi> lower; whence they let flye upon the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh.</hi> He there found, where by caſting up a little earth, the Kings people might approach within fiftie paces of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and mount foure peeces of Canon to batter upon it.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> had order alſo at his going from the King, to go call Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> to him; and in the mean time to command his troopes. Hee comming from his view, met Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> and did his meſſage to him: who told him, that he ſhould not need to goe to his troopes, for that he had left them with the Count of <hi>Iſenburg.</hi> The Duke alſo reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that whileſt he went to the King; he would doe him the fauour to goe and bring his brother Duke <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> unto his Majeſtie. But Duke <hi>William</hi> was gone to the King before; ſo that when Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> returned to the Coach; he perceived, that they with ſome great perſonages, having beene in counſell together, Whither it were beſt to retreat or not? the Retreat had beene agreed upon. Thus when Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> reported to the King, how neere to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18715:28"/> the Caſtle he might bring foure Canons: I had rather (ſayes the King) there could have beene a place found within 500 paces, then within 50: which would be ſafer for my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hereupon was order given for the retreat, and to draw off the Muskettiers; who came running off preſently. And thus much of the paſſages of this morning, have I learned from the courteſie of this Noble Warriour. The moſt of the reſt had I out of a long <hi>Latine</hi> Letter, written by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron<note n="*" place="margin">The Letter was written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brother Sir <hi>Benedict Skute,</hi> then in <hi>London:</hi> who imparted it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee. They are Sonnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord <hi>Skute,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Livonia</hi> for the Crowne of <hi>Sweden:</hi> three times Ambaſſadour into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> of <hi>Dudroff,</hi> then preſent in the action: and from a <hi>High Dutch Relation,</hi> written by an underſtanding Officer of the Army. And indeed it was high time for the King to <hi>ſound the retreat:</hi> and much better had it beene, that a <hi>Charge</hi> had never beene ſounded. It was almoſt an impoſſible thing, to get up that mountaine; and Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) freely adviſed the King the day before, That the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not faiſible. And by this time it was made much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Imperialiſts againſt this morning, had brought on more great Peeces upon their Batteries: which muſt ſorely have diſordered the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> in their advancing. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Caſtle, and Fort; were all by this time better'd mann'd then the day before: and the Imperialiſts being extremely encouraged, that the irreſiſtible <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armies, had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready overcomne them; were ſufficiently now provided to entertaine them. But the King having attempted thus much, chiefely to put a <hi>Brave</hi> upon <hi>Walenſtein:</hi> began now to think of the mens lives, that were to be caſt away upon it. So that having experience by this time, that the enemy being likely to diſpute it, would certainely kill and ſpoile him more men, then poſſibly he could doe of theirs; thought it no great wiſedome, to conſume too much time, where there was but ſmall appearance of getting over-much honour.</p>
                  <p>Order is therefore given, to have the Ordnance taken off their Batteries, and that the Muskettiers, yet in action, as alſo thoſe that had beene laid in ambuſh, below the hill: together with thoſe Horſe-troopes, which ſtood ready at all aſſayes, to waite upon the motions of the enemy, ſhould come away.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:18715:28"/>
                  <p>And this was the order of the <hi>Retreat.</hi> The <hi>Reere</hi> marcht off, firſt of all: and whileſt they turne faces about to goe homewards, the <hi>Van</hi> and <hi>Battell,</hi> ſtood their ground, as ready to receive the enemy.<note place="margin">The order of the Retreat.</note> When the <hi>Reere</hi> was comne to their place of <hi>Stand;</hi> they there made <hi>Halt,</hi> facing about againe to the enemy. Whileſt they ſtood, the <hi>Battell</hi> marched: obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in all points, the order and diſcipline of the <hi>Reere.</hi> When they make a <hi>Stand,</hi> the <hi>Van</hi> advances: the <hi>Wing</hi> of Horſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, at the ſame time moving and flancking them. Three hundred Muskettiers, with ſome Cornets of Horſe; were left behind to <hi>manne</hi> the <hi>Reere,</hi> and to make good the <hi>Retreat:</hi> in caſe the enemy (which he did not) ſhould have falne out upon them. And in this goodly order and equipage, (which was a very beautifull ſight to behold) was the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> made: all done in <hi>Battaglia,</hi> as if they had even then advanced into the <hi>Field,</hi> to have charged the enemy. Soone was the Army in their new Quarters; which were not farre from the foreſaid mountaine.</p>
                  <p>For now was the King reſolued, to entrench himſelfe cloſe unto the enemy; chooſing the place for his new Leaguer,<note place="margin">The King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campeth hard by the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</note> neere unto <hi>Furt,</hi> iuſt without the Foreſt: yea ſo neere unto <hi>Walensteins</hi> trenches, that ſome one of his greater Peeces, would haue rang'd her bullet even to the very Quarter. Early the next morning <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26. was the new Campe begunne to be fortified; that is, upon the open ſide of it: the backe-part being ſufficiently aſſured by the woods. And now might the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> (if he pleaſed) have done as much for the King, as he had attempted upon his trenches. Theſe had beene his advantages. His Leaguer was already fortified: but the Kings Works not perfected, for ſome dayes after. He, out his higher ground, might overlooke the Kings Quarters, and ſee every motion in it. The Kings Campe was in a faire <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnia,</hi> and therefore acceſſible: nor was there any thing in the way, to have hindered the Imperialiſts; from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Leaguer.</p>
                  <p>Two or three dayes after the end of the great rencounter;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18715:29"/> were the priſoners and dead, on both ſides, ranſomed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. <hi>Monſieur de la Grange</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, was ſent from the King, into the enemies Leaguer: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with many priſoners: telling his Majeſty of many things likewiſe, unto the hearing whereof but few were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. <hi>Major-Generall Sparre</hi> was not onely ſet at libertie by the King, but employed alſo by him unto <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> with the priſoners. He made likewiſe ſome generall overtures of a peace, in which he had deſired of the King, that he might uſe his owne liberty. In lieu of <hi>Major Sparre,</hi> was Colonel <hi>Leonard Tortenſon, Generall</hi> of the Kings <hi>Artillery,</hi> freely ſet at liberty by the <hi>Generaliſſimo:</hi> and that with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the King; as we haue before told you. As for Colonell <hi>Erich-Hand</hi> (a <hi>Swede</hi>) he was to ſtay in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Leaguer, till his wounds were cured. In the Bill of the priſoners, that was ſent from the Imperialiſts unto the King: were there many names read, whoſe perſons were no where to be found among the Captives:<note place="margin">The Priſoners,</note> by which they were giuen for dead.</p>
                  <p>In this former Action, were theſe men of account ſlaine on the Kings ſide. The Count of <hi>Erpach,</hi> who died of his wounds:<note place="margin">dead,</note> 
                     <hi>Generall-Major Boetius,</hi> a brave man: and Lieftenant Colonell <hi>Scepter.</hi> Of Duke <hi>Williams</hi> men, ſlaine; Lieftenant-Colonel <hi>Mackin.</hi> Vnder the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> ſlaine, Rit-maſter <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Malsburg,</hi> with Rit-maſter <hi>Craiſham,</hi> brother to the Marſhall of his Maieſties Army. Of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> divers: whoſe names I have not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">and wounded on the Kings ſide.</note>Divers other Captaines, Lieftenants, Enſignes, and other inferior Officers, there loſt their lives; with 7. or 800. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers: none of whoſe bodies, fell into the hands of the enemies. There was found ſticking in the body of one of his Maieſties Guards, a bullet of three pound weight. Wounded on the Kings ſide, the Counts of <hi>Eberſtein, Caſſel,</hi> and <hi>Thurne:</hi> with <hi>Erich-Hand, Rotſtein</hi> and <hi>Bourt;</hi> all Colonels: together with divers other Captaines, Rit-maſters, and other Officers. Of common ſouldiers, were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18715:29"/> there ſome 1500. which were brought into the Hoſpitals of <hi>Norimberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Imperiall ſide, loſt, 3. Enſignes. Slaine, the Lord <hi>Iames Fugger,</hi> Colonell of 1000. <hi>Curiaſſiers,</hi> or <hi>Men at Armes.</hi> This Lord being deadly wounded and brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into <hi>Norimberg;</hi> there expired. He being demanded what he knew of <hi>Walenſteins</hi> intentions; anſwered (as ſome report it) that he meant to keepe himſelfe in the guard hee then lay at, and to wage battell no otherwiſe then in that poſture. But ſome other report this way of his laſt words, That calling for drinke, he ſhould ſay, t'is no time to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now; <hi>Walenſtein</hi> will aſſault you: Which ſaid, he dranke, and dyed. Said to be ſlaine beſides, Colonel <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> Colonell <hi>Dom Maria de Caraffa:</hi> with 5. Colonels more: though ſome Gentlemen of our Nation, paſſing next day thorow the Campe; affirmed that they ſpake with ſome of them. Theſe things muſt be knowne from the priſoners, who being about 60. in number, perchance knew not all: the Imperialiſts having wit enough to conceale their owne loſſes. Thoſe of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide reported it from the priſoners, that there ſhould have beene ſlaine about 1000. <hi>Walſteiners:</hi> which (upon ſuch diſadvantages in the fight) I thinke not to be likely. The Corps of the dead Lord <hi>Fugger</hi> being ſent into the Imperiall Leaguer; the ſouldiers that carried him, had 25 Dollars given them.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Dutch Officer</hi> reports me a pretty ſtory of a complement (or an allegeance, rather) betwixt an humble bullet, and the K. namely, how that a piece of the ſole of his Maieſties boote, neere unto the great toe of his right foot, was carryed away with a Shot. This bullet knew his duty: for a King ſhould be toucht no higher: all are to ſtoope thither. Both he and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Lords Letter agree, that the Imperiall <hi>Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> had his Horſe that day ſhot dead under him: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (then in the action) bid me be confident; That <hi>Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> all that day, ſtirred not ſo far out of his Pavilion. Sure it is, that Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar</hi> had a horſe ſlaine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18715:30"/> under him: and that his behaviour all that fight, was beyond all expectation, valiant. <hi>Walenſtein</hi> (tis written) having falſe notice brought him in the heate of the fight, that the old Caſtle was taken; anſwered with an oath, That he would not beleeue that there was a God in Heauen, if that Caſtle could poſſibly be taken from him. This the priſoners repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And thus have I finiſhed, this moſt memorable conflict. Turne we to other actions of leſſe moment, done neere the Leaguer.</p>
                  <p>The King not able either to diſlodge <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> nor to bring him into <hi>Campagnia:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to cut off <hi>Walsteins</hi> victualls,</note> caſt about, in the next place, how to put another Brave upon him: the ſame too, that <hi>Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> firſt put upon him, to defeate him (namely) of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls.

                  <p>Now were the warres, made altogether by commanded Partees: whoſe ſending out, was chiefely to get victualls and forage for themſelues; and to defeate one another of it. The <hi>Crabats</hi> were the onely men, for ſuch a purpoſe; they acknowledge no 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Commandement: for ſtealing, is one of the great uſes of them, in the Army.

They flye out as farre as <hi>Altorff,</hi> a towne and <hi>Vniverſity</hi> of the <hi>Norimbergers,</hi> 15. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles Eaſt of the City.

                  <p>A little after this, did the King employ Lieftenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Cratzenſtein</hi> with ſome troopes of Cavallery, to lay out for theſe mad <hi>Crabats.

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:18715:31"/> became a ranſome for the Profeſſors of <hi>Altorff.</hi> Hard by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell,</hi> but neerer to <hi>Pfaffenhoven:</hi> is there pretty Caſtle, where a Cornet of <hi>Crabats</hi> were enquartered. <hi>Cratzenſtein</hi> now forcing the place, cuts moſt of the <hi>Crabats</hi> in pieces; carried away their Lieftenant-Colonell with the Houſe-keeper of the Caſtle, priſoners; ſetting divers of the Kings ſouldiers at liberty; which the <hi>Crabats</hi> there held in durance. This done, <hi>Cratzenstein</hi> returnes to <hi>Norimberg,</hi> with his booty and his priſoners.</p>
                  <p>All this ſucceeded well to him; the next encounter, he came not off with, ſo fairely.

The foremoſt of his people, there fell into an ambuſh of the <hi>Walsteiners:</hi> who not diſcovering themſelves all at once, put the <hi>Swediſh</hi> in ſuch hopes of being ſtrong enough for them; that they engaged themſelues to buckle with them. Nor could they ſee their error, till it was too late to recover it: for there loſt they 80. of their fellowes; and he was the braveſt man, that would run away to tell his Lieftenant-Colonel.</p>
                  <p>In other places at the ſame time, were the Foragers out on both ſides.<note place="margin">Divers skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, among commanded Partees.</note> A <hi>Swediſh</hi> Partee, ranging towards <hi>Newmarckt,</hi> chanc't upon 2.

At <hi>Eybach,</hi> one <hi>Dutch</hi> League South of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> there fell
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18715:31"/> out another skirmiſh: where after the exchange of ſome bullets, and the death of 40. men on both ſides; the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> were faine to giue it over: for that the Imperialiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring themſelues, by degrees, towards their owne Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (then cloſe at hand) did but traine the <hi>Swediſh</hi> into the danger.</p>
                  <p>A day or two after, the King himſelfe would needs abroad, to diſcover the poſture of the enemy: and it was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place of the laſt encounter. The King had ſome choiſe Lads, along with him; ſome of which ſcowring the coaſt before him, diſcoverd by and by,<note place="margin">The King goes out upon a Partee.</note> a good Squadron of Imperiall Hoſemen. The King bade charge; and the <hi>Walſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> made at them againe: ſo that there fell out ſome rude bruſhing betweene them. At laſt, every man of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> being as good as two, where the King was one: the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteiners</hi> went by the worſt of it; 150. men they left upon the place, divers priſoners they left behind them: and the reſt ranne away as haſtily towards their Leaguer, as if they did it to carry newes, that they had ſeene the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little after this, a ſtrong Partee of <hi>Crabats,</hi> cut ſhort ſome <hi>Swediſh</hi> Foragers; even as they had almoſt recovered to their Leaguer by <hi>Furt.</hi> Two hundred horſes and Wagons, they tooke from them, and made the Foragers glad to goe home, without that, which they had laboured for. Thence goe the <hi>Crabats</hi> to <hi>Lauff,</hi> 2. leagues Eaſt of <hi>Norimberg:</hi> putting themſelues there into ambuſh to entrap ſome <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Convoyes. It chanc't, that a good company of Wagons and loden horſes, paſſed by ſhortly after, from about <hi>Roten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg;</hi> 4. miles to the North of <hi>Lauff.</hi> The <hi>Crabats</hi> falling out upon the Booty, cut in pieces both the Wagon-drivers, and their guards: and vouchſafing to turne Carters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they drive the Wagons towards <hi>Engelthal.</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there were divers <hi>Bidets</hi> or Saddle-horſes, of ſome of the Kings owne Gentlemen, that went <hi>lier,</hi> by; now ſent for from graſſe, for that the King was about remoouing. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18715:32"/> Gentlemen hearing how likely they were to ſerue on foote; petitioned the King for a ſpeciall Partee to make out after theſe <hi>Crabats,</hi> that had vnhorſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The King himſelfe would needs do his Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlemen the ſervice, to go out with the Partee: gueſſing at their haunt; the King advances towards the ſame <hi>Engelthall:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feates ſome <hi>Crabates.</hi>

                  <p>The King having an item, a little after this, of 20. Cornets Imperiall Horſe, that purpoſed to goe from <hi>Forcheim,</hi> to ſpoyle <hi>Grefenberg,</hi> a towne of the <hi>Norimbergers,</hi> ſome 18. miles North of the City: goes with the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to have a courſe at theſe Imperialiſts. But they having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, had no deſire to ſtay and kiſſe the 2. Kings hands; but recommended their ſafeties, to their ſpurres; and eſcaped by good Horſeman-ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The King preſently upon this, had a deſigne, to have put Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> with a good part of his, and <hi>Baniers</hi> Army into, and about the towne of <hi>Liecthenaw,</hi> (not farre from <hi>Onspach</hi>) which belonged unto the <hi>Norimbergers. Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein,</hi> (as we told you in the beginning) had offered before at the taking of this towne; but had beene put beſides it. It was kept by one <hi>Scheverlin, a Patricius</hi> or City-Gentleman of <hi>Norimberg.</hi> His feare now fore-dooming, that becauſe the King had not beene able to diſlodge <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> that therefore he was too weake for him:<note place="margin">Walenſtein <hi>gets</hi> Liechtenaw.</note> delivers over his truſt unto the enemies of his Country; when as no apparent, but a ſuſpected neceſſity, drew it from him. The loſſe of this towne and Paſſe, ſhrewdly defeated the Kings projects: helpt to make him what <hi>Scheverlin</hi> had ſuſpected him; the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler to remooue <hi>Walenſtein.</hi> For now, beſides the victualls found in the towne; <hi>Walenſteins</hi> other proviſions out of thoſe parts, came the freelyer into his Leaguer: the moſt of which, the King might haue cut off, could he but haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Army thereabouts.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:18715:32"/>
                  <p>Other ſmaller bickerings betweene commanded Partees of both Armies, I purpoſely omit: for that theſe petty parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, doe leſſe concerne a generall Hiſtory. And now the King perceiving that all theſe ſlighter encounters, would not doe the great buſineſſe; and that it now proved true, which had ſo often beene confeſſed to him: namely, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> moſt firmely was with himſelfe reſolued, to tyre him out with the expectation of a Battell; and that he would upon no other termes accept of the encounter, then ſuch as with extremity of diſadvantage, he ſhould be enforced unto: iudges it his beſt courſe, to leave the ſullen or temporiſing Generall, in the faſtneſſe of his Trenches; ſeeing he would not be trained out unto a Field-Battell. For point of action and honour, the King conceiued himſelfe to be before-hand with his adverſary: ſeeing he had ſo often bidden him baſe at his owne gole; and that the Lyon-couchant would not out of his Denne, no further then he were rowſed. Carefull,<note place="margin">The Kings rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his riſing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Norimberg.</hi>
                     </note> beſides this, of the State of the good City of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> his Maieſty was: which his late encreaſed Army had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; his ſicke men, and dead horſes, both peſtered and infected. His owne Army began a-pace likewiſe, to demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: he had loſt (at leaſt) 10. or 12000. horſes, (I haue heard more) the reſt, for want of forage being likely enough to follow. His men, withall, grew thinner every day and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for what with thoſe that had beene ſlaine with the ſword, or dead of the fluxe and other diſeaſes; and what with thoſe that were wounded, taken priſoners, or had runne away; he miſſed full 10000. of his old Army. His Quarters grew very naſtie and noyſome, with the multitudes of dead horſes, which lay where they fell, vnburied. The reſt of his Army, wanted ayring and refreſhing: no enemy being ſo terrible to brave ſpirits, or ſo weakning to able bodies, as the long lying in one place, and the ordinary diſeaſes, of a Winter-Leaguer. Reſolued likewiſe he was, to doe as much for the Imperialiſts, as they had done for him: to cut off, namely, their proviſions from them: and that part of it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18715:33"/> eſpecially, with which their Leaguer had beene ſerved, out of the Biſhopricke of <hi>Aichſtet.</hi> His Partees he reſolued ſhould flye abroad, euery where, for the ſame purpoſe: his Army he was minded to encreaſe, with new levies: and with them, to fall into ſome of the Emperors or <hi>Catholicke-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi> lands; and ſo to force up <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> by a diverſion.</p>
                  <p>Some have diſputed it with themſelues, Whither the King ſhould not have done better for himſelfe, to have riſen long before this? ſo ſoone, namely, as he was made able to get away, by the comming of the Chancellor to him with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Armies. Then ſurely, had he ſaved a great ſort of men and horſes; and ſooner had He gone, ſooner muſt the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo</hi> have diſlodged.</p>
                  <p>When the matter was put to be decided upon a Carpett, Whither it were beſt for the King to riſe or no? The chiefe hinderance of the reſolution was, the Kings care for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Norimbergers:</hi> who were indeed very fearefull of themſelves, that ſo ſoone as He were gone, they ſhould be beſieged. But in that care, the King was eaſed by his Major <hi>Kniphauſen:</hi> who offered it upon the forfeiture of his head, to keepe the towne with 4000 men, in deſpight of all the enemies.<note place="margin">How the King contented the <hi>Norimbergers,</hi> concerning his riſing.</note> The King taking him at his word; ſent him into the towne to propoſe the conditions unto the Magiſtrates, and to know what they would doe in it. The conditions were, That they ſhould give Quarter and ſtipends, unto the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, left for the guard of them: That they ſhould take downe the old great Leaguer, and contract it; ſo as with 4000 men, it might bee made defenſible. The Magiſtrates, though ſomething fearefull, at firſt; yet ſo well did <hi>Kniphau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens</hi> arguments content them, that they came out to treate with the King about it. He told them, that they might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relye upon <hi>Kniphauſen;</hi> he had, upon His knowledge, fought in a village: and he knew he would doe much more, in ſo well a fortified City. His Maieſty, beſides, told them, That he would leave his Chancellor with them: whoſe perſon he would not adventure, but upon a place that he put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18715:33"/> in. As for beſieging of their towne, that (he aſſured them) was not at all to be feared: the enemy, he knew, was too wiſe, at that time of yeere to ſet him downe before ſuch a towne; and eſpecially in the neereneſſe of a royall Army, which had ſo often ſought to fight with him. Theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the ſeale of the Kings royall word to them; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ſecurity with the Burgers.

                  <p>At this <hi>Dunkelſpiel,</hi> which is 6. leagues to the South of <hi>Rotenburg,</hi> did the maine body of his Army arrive, Friday <hi>September</hi> 21.

                  </p>
                  <p>By this time had the Count <hi>de Monte Cuculi,</hi> with ſome of the Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi> people, (whom he found in the countrey) and ſome few <hi>Florentines,</hi> (lately ſent in from their Maſter the great Duke of <hi>Tuskany,</hi> to the aide of the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>) laid ſiege to the towne of <hi>Rain</hi> upon the <hi>Lech</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> neere <hi>Donawert.</hi> Colonell <hi>Mitzval,</hi> whom the King had left Governour there; made not ſuch good reſiſtance, as was requiſite. The towne, though not excellently, yet was it ſufficiently fortified: Victualls and Ammunition, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not: of men, he had 13. good Companies, Horſe and Foote: which were hands enow to have made good the place, for a longer time, againſt a farre greater oppoſition. I read of no breach yet made, but one threatned, and prepared for, is not unlikely. Some write, that <hi>Mitzval</hi> was in the name of his Company, threatned by one of his Ancients, that if he would not yeeld the towne, they would: but they that ſay ſo,<note place="margin">Monte Cuculi <hi>takes</hi> Rain <hi>in</hi> Savaria.</note> cannot proove that <hi>Mitzval</hi> either puniſht Ancient or ſouldiers, for the mutinie. Others affirme, that he had the conſent of a Counſell of Warre, of all the Officers of his garriſon for it: which had it beene true, then would not the King have executed him for it. How-ever, <hi>September</hi> 25. did <hi>Mitzval</hi> conclude upon rendring, the next day march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with Bag and Baggage, and all good conditions <hi>for</hi> a ſouldier, though not <hi>of</hi> one. The King tooke off his head for it: and ſo would he have done of all the 8. Captaines of his Regiment, but that her Maieſty the Queene of <hi>Sweden</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:18715:35"/> (who was comne all this expedition with her Lord) by the potency of a ſweet and gracious interceſſion, prevailed with the King for a pardon for them.</p>
                  <p>The King now comne to <hi>Donawert,</hi> made all the haſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to relieve his towne and garriſon in it, from <hi>Monte-Cuculi:</hi> but was not able to doe it on the ſudden, for that the towne was on the contrary ſide of the <hi>Lech</hi> to him. And it much concern'd him: for that by the taking of this towne, the Partees of Horſe that ſhould be lodged in it, would migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſturbe the trading and other intercourſe, betwixt <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> and <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Preparing, therefore, to recover it; he advances towards <hi>Oberendorff</hi> upon the <hi>Lech</hi> (hard by <hi>Rain</hi>) where there is a houſe or Caſtle of the <hi>Fuggers:</hi> neere which, there was a bridge over the <hi>Lech,</hi> as Page 139 of our <hi>Second Part,</hi> we have told you.</p>
                  <p>This Caſtle, was guarded with 150 men: and for the breaking of the bridge on that ſide next unto the King; were there ſome 250 <hi>Crabats</hi> now comne, Theſe the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon after they had burnt the bridge, but before they could get to <hi>Rain</hi> againe (where they ſhould have beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken over) he cuts the throats of all the 250 <hi>Crabats,</hi>

Hereupon fell he to repairing the bridge. About the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> was this done, and the Bridge-worke begun upon: which (ſtrange it is) that <hi>Monte-Cuculi</hi> did little or nothing in the hinderance of.

                     </note> by that wonderfull paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame <hi>Lech,</hi> which the <hi>April</hi> before, the King had made; and how dearely it had coſt <hi>Tilly</hi> to oppoſe it. He was now alſo taken off, by the diſtruſt to his owne ſtrength; and made, I beleeve, the more haſt to looke to <hi>Ingolstatt</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensburg;</hi> and to ſtay thereabouts for the Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi> comming, which was within 8 or 10 dayes after.</p>
                  <p>The King being, the ſecond time, paſſed over the <hi>Lech:</hi> in a miſty morning (one of the firſt dayes of <hi>April</hi>) comes before <hi>Rain;</hi> ere perchance he was diſcovered. The fight of

                     </note> is low and plaine: on one ſide, fenced with the river and moraſſy hollow ground; not fit to be entrenched on. The other part, had the King, at his laſt parting from <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> given order unto <hi>Mitzvall</hi> to new fortifie. This is the Eaſt ſide of the towne; and upon that, was the King faine to make his Approaches. Foure hundred men, had <hi>Monte-Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi> left within it: who, either for that <hi>Mitzvall</hi> had made the place heartleſſe and unlucky; or for that the fame and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the King, were ſo irreſiſtible in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as that it were but folly to ſtand out againſt him: they within two dayes, ſo ſoone as ever they had felt but a few peeces of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rain</hi> yeelded to the King.</note> ſend out to demand compoſition. But the King being angred for his <hi>Mitzvals</hi> late diſgrace; would affoord no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther termes unto the garriſon, but for the Horſemen to goe out without either Horſe or harneſſe, and the Foot, like foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; without other Armes, then their ſwords onely.</p>
                  <p>And thus was the towne as eaſily recovered, as it had beene loſt: ſaving that the defendants, this laſt time, had the honour to be overcome by the King of <hi>Sweden. October</hi> the fift, the King cauſed <hi>Mitzvall,</hi> by a <hi>Councell of Warre</hi> to be condemned; and the ſame day, in ſight of the whole Army to be executed: eſtabliſhing another Governour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the towne; who needed no other ſchooling to looke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Leſſon; then to ſee his Predeceſſour ryde the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold before him. This was done at <hi>Neuburg,</hi> ſome ten or eleuen miles Eaſtward upon the <hi>Danuby:</hi>

Nor were theſe preparations, onely whiſper'd of: but Art, perchance, made the rumour ring ſo much the louder, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> might likewiſe heare of it. But he either did not, or would not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to it: nor could any noiſe from <hi>Bavaria,</hi> frighten him out of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About theſe preparations, here at <hi>Neuburg,</hi> was the King, till the eighth of <hi>October:</hi> and was the next day provided for, to have gone perſonally into <hi>Ausburg.</hi> But this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Preſence, the <hi>Ausburgers</hi> were defeated of: the King, the ſame day, being gone with all ſpeed backe to <hi>Nord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this ſo ſudden departure of his Majeſtie; was an expreſſe Packet that night received from his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> having quit <hi>Franconia,</hi>

                  <p>Whileſt the King was upon his way to <hi>Norimberg,</hi> had the Generall Major <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> beſieged <hi>Lauff:</hi> which the King (we told you) before his going to <hi>Bavaria;</hi> was on the way to have reskewed. <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> had 1600 Foot, and 200 <hi>Norimbergers</hi> Horſe, with two peeces of Ordnance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the towne; and two dayes had he beſieged it, before the Kings comming had beene heard of.<note place="margin">Kinphauſen <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieges</hi> Lauff.</note> The third day, by a breach made with his two peeces, he tooke the towne: the garriſon in it, retiring themſelves into the Caſtle.

                     <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> now in poſſeſſion of the Caſtle; 7. <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſemen (not knowing of it) came that night on the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to the backe gate of the Caſtle, to give notice of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Munichs</hi> comming with 12. troopes or 1000.

                     <note place="margin">goes out upon a Partee:</note> and ſo towards <hi>Felden.</hi> The King thereupon commanded <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> to turne backe againe with him after the <hi>Bavarians:</hi> for (ſaies He) Ile not goe home againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ſomething.

                     </note> There the King left <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> with his owne men and 2. peeces, to repriſe it; which he did, within an houre after the Kings going.</p>
                  <p>The King purſuing <hi>Munich</hi> by the tracke: light upon ſome of his people, as they were reſting themſelues at <hi>Schlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cten,</hi> and another village, hard by <hi>Felden.</hi> Many of theſe were <hi>Crabats;</hi> whom the King had the killing of 300. upon the place; with the taking of ſome 2. Cornets, and divers priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The King having cauſed the villages they were enquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in, to be firſt ſurrownded, and then fired; had the knocking of them downe, as they ſtart out to have eſcaped. Some Relations tell me of 600. <hi>Bavarians,</hi> that ſhould be enquartered in a village betwixt <hi>Altfelt</hi> and <hi>Eiſmanſberg,</hi> a little Eaſt of <hi>Herſchbruck,</hi> who ſhould have comne out of <hi>Reichelſwang</hi> Caſtle:<note place="margin">himſelfe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feates <hi>Munich,</hi> in his Quarters.</note> and were of thoſe that ſhould have relieved <hi>Lauff.</hi> And theſe (tis ſaid) the King at one a clocke at night falling upon; cut off a great many, tooke 50. priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of them; the reſt ſaving themſelues in <hi>Rotenberg.</hi> But I ſuppoſe both theſe, to have bin but one action; for that the taking of 2.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18715:38"/> done, the King October 15. betwiȝt 5. and 6. in the euening, returned againe into <hi>Norimberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus had the King once againe cleered all the townes of the Iuriſdiction of the <hi>Norimbergers,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The King October 17. taking his laſt leave of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimbergers,</hi> goes himſelfe with <hi>Steinbocks</hi> old Convoy; to follow Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Army: his owne men,<note place="margin">He goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Army.</note> both thoſe that came out of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and thoſe that were now drawne out of <hi>Norimberg;</hi> following as faſt as they could, after. October 19, the King came to <hi>Kitzing</hi> upon the <hi>Mayn;</hi> 40. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles, to the North-Weſt of <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Here his Queene then was; who thence went towards <hi>Wurtsburg:</hi> whence after a few dayes, She came unto <hi>Erfurt;</hi> being gotten thither, before the Kings comming.</p>
                  <p>And here having mentioned Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> and his Army: let us now goe backe a little (in the meane time that the Kings owne Army is upon their march, this way-ward) to tell how he paſſed away the time, ever ſince the Kings going from him into <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King (as we told yon) parted from him about <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 15: whoſe charge to Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> was,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Story, in the Kings abſence.</note> To obſerue the motions of the Imperiall <hi>Generaliſſimo;</hi> and well to guard
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18715:39"/> the Imperiall towne of <hi>Schwinfurt,</hi> with all the reſt upon the <hi>Mayn-ſtreame,</hi> from him. For this purpoſe, had the King left him an Army of ſome 9000. or 10000 men: or at leaſt, ſo many they were voyced for.</p>
                  <p>This young Duke, ſome dayes after the Kings going; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooues from <hi>Winſhaim</hi> firſt of all, unto <hi>Kitzing</hi> upon the <hi>Mayn:</hi> where he ſtaid 6. or 7. dayes. That is, towards the very end of <hi>September.</hi> Thence advances he to <hi>Wurtsburg;</hi> where the Army ſtaid 7. or 8. dayes, being enquartered in the Suburbs. Thence goes he to a Dorp within halfe an houres going of <hi>Schweinfurt:</hi> where he was 3. or 4. dayes more. About 9. or 10. a clocke the laſt of theſe nights, the Army had ſudden order to remooue to <hi>Schweinfurt,</hi> and quartered there under the very walls of the towne. The occaſion of this remoovall was; for that the Imperialiſts having ſome Horſe Partees abroad, were likely enough to affront this their open Quarter. Here ſtaid Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> but one day: remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the next towards <hi>Konigſhoven,</hi> and enquartering ſhort of it. Some fortnight before this time, had <hi>Dubatell</hi> with his Dragooners, beene ſent into <hi>Coburg Castle:</hi> as in <hi>Walenſteins</hi> proceedings we ſhall after tell you.<note place="margin">Pag: 803.</note> The <hi>Soldat Suedois</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> before this time ſhould haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated 40. troopes of <hi>Crabats,</hi> under the command of <hi>Iſolani</hi> their Colonell Generall, and chiefeſt Commander of their Nation. But of this airy defeate; thoſe Gentlemen of our Nation, all this time with Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> knew nothing: nor doe I beleeve Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> to have then beene ſtrong enough in Horſe,<note place="margin">More of Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> ſee in <hi>Walensteins</hi> Proceeding.</note> to have beaten <hi>Iſolani,</hi> with 40. of his Cornets: which could not bee leſſe then 3000.

                  <p>From <hi>Konigſhoven,</hi> went Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> unto <hi>Hilperhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> and enquartered ſhort of it.

                     </note> upon their march towards him. This was about <hi>October</hi> 21: ſo that in 14 dayes he had marched from <hi>Bavaria</hi> into <hi>Duringen:</hi> and ſtayed three at <hi>Norimberg.</hi> The next day, the King caſhiered the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Regiments; and that by reaſon of the extreame weakeneſſe of the Companies. Theſe being thus made <hi>Reformadoes,</hi> were ordered by the King to waite upon his owne perſon: he promiſing them good Quarters, and to preferre them. Thence went the King with Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Army, thorow the <hi>Duringer-Waldt</hi> the next day, unto <hi>Arnſtat,</hi> 9. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles further, and in the County of <hi>Duringen.</hi> And here ſtaid he 6. dayes, that is till his other Army was October 27. comne up to him. That day, went the Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtiern</hi> backe from the King towards <hi>Franckford;</hi> to order things thereabouts, and in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate.</hi>

                     <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iudes</hi> day, October 28. whileſt the conioyned Army advanced before, towards <hi>Erfurt,</hi> iuſt 8. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles North of <hi>Arnſtat:</hi> the King ſtaying behind a while, wrote his laſt letters unto the King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> which letters are in the hands of many Gentleman. About an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile without <hi>Erfurt,</hi> in a very faire Campagnia;<note place="margin">The King muſters.</note> was the whole Army drawne up into Battaglia: the King taking a view of every <hi>Brigade;</hi> and appointing their place and orders to each of them. Now were divers Regiments reduced into one <hi>Brigade,</hi> being too weake each of them, to have ſtood by themſelves againſt an enemy.<note place="margin">His numbers.</note> The whole Army was found to bee about 12000.

                  <p>Hither the ſame afternoone, came 4. of the chiefe of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt,</hi> to invite his Maieſty into their City: for thither was his Queene the ſame day arrived. The King anſwered, that though he had much to ſay unto their Magiſtrates, yet knew he not how his leiſure would ſerue him to come among them. He that writes this, was one of the 4. that now were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18715:40"/> the Kings enviters: who affirmes, that the Kings words were ſo gracious; that he could not without ſhedding of teares, repeate them. Towards night the King came: a lighting from his Horſe before Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymars</hi> lodging: who having a long time layne there ſicke, the King now went to give a viſit unto.<note place="margin">Lodges in <hi>Erfurt.</hi>
                     </note> Returning thence, he went on horſe-backe, to his owne lodging: before which, upon the Market place; he was received by his Queene and her Ladies. His Maieſty leading his Queene up the ſtaires into her owne Chamber, returned quickly into his owne: where a great many of intercepted letters were preſented unto him. Theſe having ſcarce peruſed, he was called out to Supper: Duke <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar</hi> being entertained with the King and Queene,<note place="margin">That Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> was not now there, we ſhall by and by tell you the reaſon.</note> at the ſame table.

                  <p>Having ſpent a great part of the night in diſpatches, giving order for letters, and ſending away of Poſts: he roſe againe in the morning very early. Having broken his faſt and taken his laſt leave of his Queene; he then gaue audience to the City Magiſtrates, who there waited for it. To their Speech, did the King himſelfe returne a long, and very pleaſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: of which, theſe were the laſt words. You know, that in humane affaires, there is no conſtancy; and that for our ſinnes ſake, the warres, of all things elſe, are moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18715:43"/> his power, he ſeem'd, at firſt hearing,<note place="margin">What <hi>Walen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> had done all this time upon the King,</note> to have gained this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation unto his cauſe; That he had, at leaſt, put the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to a <hi>Demurrer,</hi> if not utterly <hi>Non-ſuited</hi> him. For this ſervice, was the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> (as he deſerved) much courted and thanked from <hi>Vienna:</hi> his diſcreet conduct in it, extraordinarily applauded by his Maſter: yea and his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (upon demaund) by anew Imperiall Commiſſion, ſtrangely now augmented. The Kings neceſſities having brought him to it, That he muſt needs riſe firſt, or lye ſtill and doe nothing; <hi>Walenſtein</hi> contented himſelfe with this honour, That he had put him to theſe neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>The King being firſt marcht off; and <hi>Walenſtein</hi> by his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pialls aſſured, that it was no plot in the King; no tricke to wheele about, and to aſſayle him in another quarter;<note place="margin">He riſes:</note> but that he was already ſet downe at <hi>Neuſtat,</hi> for the refreſhing of his Army: he, having no more to doe here, reſolues alſo to be riſing. This motion was much put forward by theſe and the like reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Should he lye long, other places muſt ſuffer:<note place="margin">and his reaſons for it.</note> ſo that there was a preſent and a preſſing neceſſity for him to relieve other places, with ſome of his forces. The Generall-Adjutant <hi>Zinzindorff,</hi> is therefore ſent with 2. Regiments into <hi>Auſtria;</hi> to repreſſe the Commotion of the Boores, there. <hi>Gallas</hi> is with 4. Regiments, diſpatched thorow the <hi>Vpper Palatinate</hi> into <hi>Voitland,</hi> to enable <hi>Holck</hi> to doe the more miſchiefe there, and in <hi>Miſnia:</hi> ſo to enforce the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to recall his Army out of <hi>Sileſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He perceived his mightie vaſte Army, to waſte away apace. Some thouſands had beene ſlaine; many dead, and runne away; divers ſpoyl'd, and made unſerviceable. The <hi>bloody Fluxe</hi> reigned mightily in his Leaguer: and the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers great complaint was, of an extraordinarie want, both of Phyſicke and of Surgerie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His Horſes, (the pride and ſtrength of his Army, at his firſt comming) beganne now to die apace: of which he had at leaſt 14. or 15000. ſtarved, &amp; yet I ſpeake much within
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18715:44"/> compaſſe, of what I have heard. Their Carrion was very noyſome unto the Quarters: and yet had his men taken better order, then the Kings people had, to carry away and bury them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Kings labour, he knew, to be one of theſe two: either to cut off his victuals or proviſions from him; or elſe to fall into ſome friends country. If the King, now, ſhould doe the firſt, then could not he lye long: and if the ſecond, then would the King have gotten the ſtart of him. The greatneſſe of his ſpirit being to be of the active, fore-hand; to make the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> follow him; and not he to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Towne of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> though it had beene part of his errand for comming thither; yet beſides that hee ſhould be likely to looſe his labour, in attacking a place ſo well-provided for reſiſtance: he did not thinke it Souldier-like done of him, to ſit taking of one towne, whileſt his enemy ſhould be conquering of whole Countryes. For <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg,</hi> therefore, he tooke order to have it ſtill blockt up; by <hi>Gallas</hi> taking of <hi>Lauff,</hi> and other townes and Paſſes about it: and for the reſt, he would try Maſteries with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who ſhould divert one another.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly and laſtly, he might doubt, That when the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould have well ayred, refreſhed and recreuted his Army: and have provided himſelfe of new Horſes: that hee were then likely enough to returne a-freſh upon his Leaguer; and then either put him to fight, or ſtarve by it.</p>
                     <p>Which of the two Armies, could then have found the ſharper ſwords, or the fuller <hi>Bandeliers;</hi> muſt now have beene left unto the tryall: but the <hi>Walſteiners,</hi> by having the ſtronger place of encamping, and the fuller knap-ſacks; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their being put unto that tryall.</p>
                     <p>Wedneſday, <hi>September</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, was the day appointed for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping. Repairing the Bridge, therefore, over the river <hi>Rednitz</hi> a little North of <hi>Furt:</hi> hee there wafts over his whole Army: not halfe ſo great now, as when he firſt came
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18715:44"/> to <hi>Norimberg.</hi> Some writing tels mee, that <hi>Walenſteins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moovall was by night: but in that (me thinks) his haughty ſpirit is much injuryed: hee that upon a march, forbids to have the Ports ſhut where he Quarters: would never, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſteale away by a dark lanterne. And that it was not in the darke, was viſible enough at preſent: for the Souldiours not onely ſet fire upon their Huts and Quarters, at their riſing; but upon the Countrey too. A hundred Dorps and houſes, were now dreſt up in flame, in the Marquiſate of <hi>Onſpach,</hi> and the Iuriſdiction of the <hi>Norimbergers:</hi> as if to ſacrifice to <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Bellona,</hi> with this Hecatomb. <hi>Foule warres, or no warres,</hi> is a <hi>Maxime</hi> among ſome ſouldiours, otherwiſe not cruelly minded: but <hi>Walenſtein</hi> is not ſo well made up in this; for that his haughtineſſe wants an alloy or temperature of <hi>pittie,</hi> in it. The <hi>Crabats,</hi> ſure, had done nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily worthy of a triumph: and yet could they not find in their hearts to leave the Countrey, without kindling of 100 Bonfires in it. Nor is this the firſt time, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> hath done ſo: but as if he this way affected, to be called the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt of Warre;</hi> hee nor goes nor comes, ſcarcely, but in <hi>flames</hi> and <hi>flaſhing,</hi> and in this <hi>imitated lightning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the time that the Imperiall Army was marching by, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces in and before <hi>Norimberg;</hi> ſtood caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly upon their guards: and the Army being a little paſt them, ſome troopes of Horſe (as uſually in ſuch caſes they will doe) fell out of the towne and Trenches, and exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a few bullets with their Reere; though little or nothing to the purpoſe. I omit the <hi>Norimbergers</hi> rifling of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Leaguer: where for want of Horſes, the Imperialiſts had left an incredible world of Military luggage behind them. This, as it ſhowed how excellently well provided, <hi>Walenſtein</hi> had comne into the Field: ſo it was a kind of Iuſtice, to leave the <hi>Norimbergers</hi> ſomething of good value behind them: to pay themſelves withall, for the courteſie and coſt, they ſhould beſtow upon the many maimed and ſicke ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which were there found a ſtarving and a ſtinking. This
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18715:45"/> is the guiſe and fortune of the warres: nor can theſe who have beene bred full tenderly have their mothers with them in the Leaguer, to looke to them. By theſe was the want diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which ſince the Kings going, was increaſing every day more then other: and the reaſons given (which wee have before pointed at) for <hi>Walenſteins</hi> diſcamping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The deviding of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Army,</note>A little beyond the Citie; is the Imperiall Army devided. <hi>Zinzindorff</hi> (as we told you) is ſent to <hi>Auſtria:</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall-Major <hi>Gallas</hi> with part of the Army, goes Eaſtward towards <hi>Lauff,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">of <hi>Gallas,</hi> we ſhall tell you altogether, by and by.</note> two leagues from <hi>Norimberg;</hi> which having taken, with ſome other townes, to keepe the <hi>Norimbergers</hi> blockt up: he marches by the corner of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> into <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> The two Dukes of <hi>Fridland</hi> and <hi>Bavaria;</hi> turning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about to the <hi>left;</hi> come the firſt night unto <hi>Bruck,</hi> ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the North of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> and ſixe from <hi>Furt.</hi>

                           <hi>Walensteins</hi> way,</note> The river of <hi>Rednitz,</hi> he ſtill kept upon his left hand: which was a ſure barricado on that ſide againſt the King of <hi>Sweden. Walenſtein</hi> in deviding his Army, had this good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: that having ſent away his two great Officers, <hi>Holck</hi> before, and <hi>Gallas</hi> now: yet it was but to the place where he meant to follow them; or could, if he were put to it, preſently recall them. His meaning was, to undoe the Duke of <hi>Saxony:</hi> and thither had he ſent theſe two. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe advanc't now towards <hi>Duringen:</hi> and thither was it agreed that <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> from the <hi>Weſer,</hi> ſhould come and joyne with him. This was <hi>Walenſteins</hi> happineſſe, that the place marckt out for his revenge, lay ſo conveniently for him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Numbers,</note>The numbers of his Army, were not above twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand (beſides nine or ten thouſand of the Duke of <hi>Bavariaes</hi>) Foote, or fifteene thouſand complete marching men, (at the moſt) and nine or ten thouſand Horſe: and ſo much had the King intelligence of. The reſt of his ſixtie thouſand, had beene kill'd, dead, runne away, ſent other where, with <hi>Holck, Gallas, Zinzindorff</hi> and into <hi>Bavaria:</hi> put into garriſons in the <hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18715:45"/> the Quarters: for certainly, both <hi>Walenſtein</hi> and the King, loſt more for either of their parts, at this lingring Leaguer; then the King and <hi>Tilly</hi> both, at the great Battell of <hi>Leipſich. Walenſtein</hi> at his firſt riſing, had given order for the ſending before of ſome of his greater Ordnance, unto <hi>Forcheim:</hi> for guarding whereof, hee ſuppoſed a ſmall Convoy would be ſufficient.<note place="margin">and order of marching.</note> Some <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe-Partees (as it chanced) were at that time gone abroad into the Biſhopricke of <hi>Bamberg:</hi> who being by the Boores diſcovered unto <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> cauſed him to countermand his owne order, and to have his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from thence-forth, to march with the groſſe of his Army. Where the breadth of the way would ſuffer him, there he advanced in <hi>Battaglia:</hi> the Dragooners with their Muskets, Shovels, and Mattocks, (with which they ſtill ride) were euer ſent before, to make good the Paſſes: and the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,</hi> (being his nimbleſt Horſe) were ſtill left behind, to bring up the Reere of the Army. And in the ſouldierly wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this equipage, he marches unto <hi>Forcheim:</hi> for in the neereneſſe of an active enemy, it much concerned him to bee thus wary.</p>
                     <p>The Army being come to <hi>Forcheim;</hi> was there in a friends Countrey, and in good Quarter: and there I finde <hi>Walenſtein</hi> to have ſtayed about ten dayes or a Fortnight. Here had hee notice firſt given him, of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> going with halfe his Army towards <hi>Bavaria:</hi> and of Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> ſtaying with the other halfe, about the <hi>Main-ſtreame.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this intelligence, he now diſpoſes of his Forces. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being moſt ſtartled at it; deſires to take leave of the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> with his part of the Army: requeſting that <hi>Altringer</hi> with his Regiment and <hi>Coloredoes,</hi> might goe along with him, for the direction of the <hi>Militia.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> grants it; and himſelfe waiting (as he call'd it) upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as farre as <hi>Bamberg:</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18715:46"/> yet ſo artfully commanding of their owne carriages; that though each of then were conſcious, how much cauſe they had given one another to diſſemble: yet with ſtudied words and faces, did they full maſterly controll all that ſtomacke and diſreſpect, by which they had thorowly, heretofore, enchafed one another. The Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> ſeemed to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that ever <hi>Bavaria</hi> had procured him to be caſhiered from his Generallſhip, in the <hi>Diete</hi> of <hi>Ratisbone:</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> gave the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> never a note in the Margent, how often (ſince this Leaguer) he had beene faine to waite, to get to ſpeake with him. They are fellowes in Armes, from hence forward: they proteſted to ſerve one another, in all good offices; and to ſecond one another, upon all occaſions. One thing was noted betweene them, in this vieing of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: That <hi>Walenſtein</hi> was not ſo ſupple and active in his cringes, as old <hi>Bavaria.</hi> But this, (what ever his great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit meant by it) he excuſed by his Gowte, and other his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildyneſſes.

                     <p>Early, <hi>September</hi> 24. went the two Dukes with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of their Army, and 48.

Five hundred ſouldiers, thereupon, being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the dry <hi>Graff</hi> or Moate of the Caſtle; clap to their ſcaling ladders, to ſtorme it.

Some make him to be knockt downe by the Boores of <hi>Voitland,</hi> a little after this: but I rather conſent to this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which giues him to be kild here; for that I reade his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be with much ſolemnity, carried from the Campe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Zroicka</hi> in <hi>Voitland,</hi> to be enterred in his owne Lordſhip in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> ſomething before that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> was gotten into <hi>Voitland.</hi> But this is no great controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> perceiving the Caſtle to be ſtrong, high ſituated,<note place="margin">and raiſeth his owne ſiege.</note> well provided, and the beſieged reſolved for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; he gave no more on upon it after this one repulſe, had beene given him. But this was not all the reaſon, for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his ſiege: Duke <hi>Bernard Weymar</hi> was by this time come from <hi>Schweinfurt</hi> to <hi>Konigſhoven,</hi> 17. miles due Weſt of <hi>Coburg;</hi> and was thence marcht to <hi>Hilperhauſen,</hi> upon the edge of the <hi>Duringer-Waldt,</hi> within 13. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the North-Weſt of this <hi>Coburg.</hi> And he, (as <hi>Walenſtein</hi> might ſuſpect) though not ſtrong enough to encounter him in the open field, yet was hee able enough to diſturbe him at a ſiege. And this ſiege, above all the reſt; for that Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> is to be heire unto this Towne and Dukedome of <hi>Coburg,</hi> after the deceaſe of<note n="*" place="margin">One of theſe, is dead ſince: he namely that was then in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, when his towne was beſieged.</note> two of his old childleſſe Vnckles.</p>
                     <p>Now had our <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> a purpoſe, to have advanced further to the Northward, and to have pierced thorow, by the way of the <hi>Duringer-Waldt</hi> into <hi>Duringen:</hi> where <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi> was to haue ioyned with him. But this deſigne was now defeated, by Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> putting himſelfe iuſt before him:<note place="margin">By Duke <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> good ſervice.</note> which was a very great piece of ſervice. By this meanes, was the Caſtle of <hi>Coburg</hi> reskeued; and the whole little Country of <hi>Henneberg,</hi> in which it is ſeated. Had <hi>Walenſtein</hi> gone forward with his proiect: then had <hi>Hilperhauſen, Schleuſing, Aiſchfelt, Ilmenaw,</hi> and <hi>Arnſtat,</hi> beene taken by him. Then had all the Paſſes thorow the <hi>Duringer-Waldt,</hi> beene blockt up by his people, which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> muſt by mayne force haue againe opened, before euer he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18715:48"/> could have comne up to <hi>Walenſtein.</hi> Then, in the meane time, would he and <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> have recovered <hi>Erfurt:</hi> with the townes about it: made himſelfe maſter, of the whole <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graviate</hi> of <hi>Duringen;</hi> have over-runne the lands of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> (and ſometimes <hi>Electorall</hi>) Family of <hi>Saxon-Weymar.</hi> Then had he, thorow that rich Country, beaten out his way into the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxonyes Miſnia:</hi> have wintered and enriched his Army in thoſe Countries: and beene ready with the firſt of the next Spring,<note place="margin">is <hi>Walenſteins</hi> great proiect defeated.</note> to have fallen into <hi>Luſatia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia.</hi> Then would he have made himſelfe maſter, of the river <hi>Elb:</hi> and ſo have cut off the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> retreate, home againe. Then would <hi>Walenſtein</hi> haue cleered his (titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary) Dukedome of <hi>Mecklenburg:</hi> and hewen out himſelfe a free paſſage, to his old Quarters in <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania;</hi> and againe poſſeſſed himſelfe, of the banks of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Ocean. And thus handſomely had our <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> contrived it: the effecting of which project was worth the abandoning all the <hi>lower Saxony,</hi> by the calling away of <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi> out of it: and in the higheſt degree concerned the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to make ſuch haſt out of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
                     <p>All the former part of this project, was now defeated by Duke <hi>Bernard:</hi> the taking, namely, of the <hi>Landtgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi> of <hi>Duringen,</hi> with the Dukedome of <hi>Weymar:</hi> as likewiſe the conioyning of <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> with his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo:</hi> which hee durſt not after attempt to doe, till he knew that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> was falne by another way, into <hi>Miſnia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus was the Imperiall Generall enforced, not to raiſe his ſiege onely from before the Caſtle of <hi>Coburg:</hi> but to quit likewiſe his intended march thorow the rich, and (of late) un-plundered Countrey of <hi>Thuringia.</hi> Turning faces about therefore, to the right; (his ſouldiers burning downe <hi>Helberck, Neustat,</hi> and other Dorps about <hi>Coburg</hi>) he marches directly by the towne of <hi>Cronach,</hi> into <hi>Voitland;</hi>

It was a deepe prepenſed reſolution in the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo,</hi> to pay the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to the purpoſe: he was once in a quandary, when as he had newly taken <hi>Prague;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould firſt fall into <hi>Saxony,</hi> or come againſt the King <hi>Sweden.</hi> And had not the King beene ſo neere him, at that very time; in ſuch danger to have overthrowne the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> firſt; and then, in his abſence, to have falne into <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia:</hi> he would, (no doubt) have firſt gone againſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, at him he goes.

In great and confuſed numbers, therfore, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues together to be revenged: they with the beſt weapons, that a ruſticall fury, could put into their hands; firſt turne feare into deſpaire, and that into deſperateneſſe: which in ſtead of skill, order, and true valour; they made to ſerue their turnes againſt the invaders. Beſetting the woods, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the bye-waies; which the ſeeking for their loſt Cowes, now and then, had heretofore made them perfect at: they <hi>with as good a will as ever Boores gate children;</hi> knockt downe ſuch rambling and plundering boote-halers, of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Army; as they could ſingly light upon, and maſter. This is he that rid away with my horſe, cries one; downe with him: that fellow ſtole my 2. kyne, ſaies a ſecond; cut the throat of him: and he, carried away all my wiues ducks tother day, cryes a third Boore; knocke him downe too. All the Quarter they would give the ſouldiers, was to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe whom they had killed; and to mangle thoſe bodies, whom they had mawled: as if every blowe they gave a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouldier, had killed them another enemy; becauſe it (in part) ſatisfied their revenge, by the acting of another cruelty. And here (ſaies ſome Relations) was the young <hi>Walenstein</hi> killed: of whom we before ſpake, in the action of <hi>Coburg.</hi> But the <hi>Walſteiners</hi> were even with the poor Boores for it;

                     <p>The place of this Country of <hi>Voitland,</hi> is betwixt <hi>Durin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Franconia, Miſnia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia:</hi> and the reaſon that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> did now enter into it, was partly, to beare all the country along before him; and partly, to lay the ſeate of the warres in an enemies Countrey. And who can denie this, to have beene ſouldierly done of him? But that he had firſt commanded in <hi>Holck</hi> and <hi>Gallas</hi> into it; and did now follow himſelfe with fire and ſword, in it: was not ſo much upon the barbariſme, or tyrannicall delight in blood and cruelty; but out of the terror of a military policy: that with the feare and horror to ſee his ſubiects ſo uſed,<note place="margin">and his reaſons for it.</note> he might conſtraine the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> unto a ſudden and diſadvantageous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; with whom the courtſhips of repeated Ambaſſages from the Emperor, had not heretofore prevailed.

That to the Magiſtrates, was to this purpoſe; That the Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> his <hi>Excellency,</hi> did in faire termes deſire, and in the name of his Imperiall Maieſty adviſe them, to commit themſelues unto his mercy, as other Cities had done. That, moreover, they would receiue 200. of Colonel <hi>Hatzfelds</hi> Horſe-men, into their Caſtle; and reſigne up themſelues wholly, unto the ſervice and devotion of his Imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty. This if they refuſed, then had his Excellency iuſt cauſe, with his whole power to come from <hi>Altemburg</hi> upon them; and to make their ruine an example, unto all the Cities of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The letter to the Military men, was, an invitation to them, to yeeld upon faire termes: an offer of good Quarter, to as many as would march out quietly: and of honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both to Officers and Souldiers, (either on horſebacke or on foote) as many as would take entertainement. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18715:57"/> men anſwered plainely,<note place="margin">Their anſwer.</note> That they would not yeeld; and the Magiſtrates, ſhufflled off the buſineſſe to the ſouldiery: anſwering by the ſame Trumpet, that the Caſtle was a Fort, which they had no command of: nor could they tell, how to get the ſouldiers out of the City: and that having tendered his Excellencies letters to the Governour of the Caſtle, hee would not open them, becauſe not by name directed to him. And with theſe anſwers, the Trumpet returned towards the Leaguer.</p>
                     <p>That which made the <hi>Leipſichers</hi> ſo valorous, in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; was a hope they had upon their Duke, partly: who was now going from <hi>Dreſden</hi> unto <hi>Torgau</hi> upon the <hi>Elb:</hi> there (as they hoped) to ſtay for <hi>Arnheims</hi> comming out of <hi>Sileſia</hi> with the Army. They had a confidence alſo, upon Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> comming to relieve them, by the way of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringen.</hi> But that hope, was quickly daſht by <hi>Pappenheims</hi> falling into the ſaid <hi>Duringen:</hi> who gat before hand with Duke <hi>Bernard:</hi> which Duke had neither ſtrength nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to relieue them.</p>
                     <p>Friday October 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. about noone; ſome Imperiall horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, together with 80. Muskettiers; drew neere unto the wals of the City; and about the burying place (commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods-Aker</hi>) they made an orderly <hi>Court of guard:</hi> which they held unto the evening. About 2. a clocke, the former Trumpet came againe into the City. Being preſently brought before the Magiſtrates: and delivering his ſummons by word of mouth; he by word of mouth had his deniall given him. His meſſage was. That his Excellency the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> had not been uſed to be put off with words; nor to ſend twice to one purpoſe: and therefore did now adviſe them to give him a ſpeedy ſatisfaction, by putting themſelues under his obedience: otherwiſe, they muſt not hereafter expect any mercy, but to be made an example to all that continued in their obſtinacy. The Cities anſwer was, That they had no power to diſpoſe of their Princes City, without their Princes leave for it: and therefore deſired his Excellency to reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18715:57"/> with it. By this time, a greater ſtrength of Imperiall Horſe, preſented themſelues before the City, to anſwer whom, did ſome Muskettiers make a ſally: the Ordnance from the walls likewiſe playing very hard upon them. About 4. a clock, divers Imperiall Cornets more, charging hard upon the <hi>Leipſich</hi> Muskettiers, beate them into the City.</p>
                     <p>Sunday October 21. by breake of day, did the Imperiall Armies begin to draw round about the towne: and to bring on their Ammunition, and all other preparations for a ſiege. Then beganne the <hi>Walſteiners</hi> to breake the ground, and to bring forward their Approaches. Some Muskettiers, were immediately alſo lodged in one of the Suburbs. The Ordnance went off roundly from all parts of the wall: whoſe peales continued untill the evening. This day, were two other Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſent from the Leaguer into the ſurrownded City; who were brought into the Statehouſe before the Magiſtrates: to whom they in the afternoone delivered their meſſage. About this time, was there a ſhort pawſe or ceſſation from ſhooting. Theſe Trumpets being returned into the Leaguer; another was preſently diſpatched towards the City: ſo willing was our <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> to winne a towne by parlyes, rather then by fighting. This Trumpet was not diſpatched till within euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The report went, of his meſſage, That the Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> vowed he would have the City, either by faire meanes, or by foule: and if they would yeeld it willingly, they ſhould haue good Quarter: but in caſe they ſtood it out; he proteſted deeply, that neither man, woman nor child, no nor ſo much as a dog; ſhould ever goe alive out of the City. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſtein</hi> was as likely to be a man of his word, as any man (that I know) in the world, in <hi>Turky</hi> or in <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Imperiall Foote that were lodged in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> let flye their vollyes into the City: with which, though divers were hurt, yet was there but one boye ſlaine out-right, neere unto the great Colledge. About night, they began on both ſides to draw towards an agreement: and yet (as thoſe of <hi>Leipſich</hi> write of themſelues) very doubtfull it was whither
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18715:58"/> or no they ſhould ever come to an accord; for that the towneſmen were very reſolute, and averſe from yeelding. It being once darke, the Imperialiſts out of the Suburbs; heaved <hi>hand-Granadoes,</hi> and other Wild-fires, into the City: which not onely gave light, but fire alſo in 2. places unto it. This was with much diligence, and little loſſe, quenched: nor did Fire-balls doe much more hurt, then take off one ſouldiers right legge, whereof next morning he died. The fight on both ſides continuing, another Imperiall Trumpet preſented himſelfe before the Ports of the City: but the ſmall and great ſhot going off ſo inceſſantly, both from the walls and Caſtle; it was hote ſtaying for him there: that he againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, without delivering of his meſſage. Preſently was he ſent backe againe: and this was the ſumme of his errand. That his Excellency the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> was contented to allow them 6. houres more, to conſider upon it: in which time if they reſolved to entertaine parly, they ſhould ſend him out their Deputies unto <hi>Schonfeld,</hi> where they ſhould be treated with.</p>
                     <p>By 6. a clocke the next Munday morning <hi>October</hi> 21. Some of the <hi>

About noone, the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall forces, with ſound of Drumme, and all gallantry, entred the City, preſently poſſeſſing themſelues of the <hi>Petriner Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> About 4. a clocke the ſame day, did the Felt-Marſhall <hi>Holck,</hi> and many other Imperiall Officers; ride alſo into the ſame Colledge: taking a diligent view all about it; how they might moſt conveniently plant ſome peeces of Ordnance in it, to play thence upon the Caſtle. Hereupon were 4. halfe Cannons brought into the City; and 3. Batteries were with Horſe-dung and boards upon them made up immediately, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle. One, was neere the <hi>Peters</hi> Tower, and the other 2. in the <hi>Petriner</hi> Colledge aforeſaid. Vpon each of theſe Batteries, they mounted one peece of Ordnance: and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18715:58"/> with every one of them, they plaid all that whole night, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſtle. Divers Enſignes of Foote, kept their guards upon the Market place, in the meane time: amongſt whom, was there a goodly troope of Curiaſſiers (Horſemen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate harneſſe) conſiſting of ſome 180.</p>
                     <p>The Commander of the Caſtle the ſame man (as I heare) that before delivered it up to the Generall <hi>Tilly,</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt Battell of <hi>Leipſich,</hi> and called <hi>Iohannes Vopelius,</hi> hung out the <hi>defenſive Banner</hi> from the top of the Caſtle; and (as if he ſcorned to be twice taxed, with the ſhame of giving over one Caſtle) he plaid very hard with his great Ordnance upon the Imperialiſts: even from their firſt entring into the Colledge; untill broad day light upon Tueſday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. That day, being the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. the Imperialiſts having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Ordnance but 17. times in all; the bloody Flag was taken downe from the Caſtle; and a white Flag of truice put up in the roome of it: to ſignifie their deſire of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Shooting is then given over: and hoſtages and Deputies are ſent one to another, to conclude upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: That evening were they accorded: and to this purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, That the garriſon ſhould march out with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, matches lighted, full armes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Theſe marching forth of the Caſtle; 2. Companies of Imperialiſts, immediately take poſſeſſion of it. That very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening were the Burgers called together, and commanded to bring their Armes to be laid up into the State-houſe. That night, was the neighbour village of <hi>Eiteritch,</hi> by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts burnt downe to the ground: divers houſes alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Leipſich;</hi> thoſe eſpecially next unto the Caſtle and river, were plundered.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18715:66"/> he commanded his Baggage to ſtay with the garriſon ſtill in <hi>Naumburg;</hi> for a day or two; being, he thought but onely to have gone and joyned with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and then to have returned againe to <hi>Naumburg.</hi> Hee ſuppoſing, withall, that <hi>Pappenheim</hi> being now abſent, and <hi>Walenſteins</hi> men not together, that he ſhould not be diſturbed in his march: about foure before day-light (the Drums having beaten ever ſince one a clocke,) on the Munday morning, he advances towards <hi>Pegau.</hi> The King having notice, of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſteins</hi> forſaking <hi>Weiſſenfels:</hi> ſends by the way, to take in that Caſtle. The hundred men that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> had left in it, did <hi>Coloredo</hi> come ſo timely to fetch off; that he had done it, a very little, before the <hi>Swedes</hi> comming.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of his march, about ten a clocke, the ſame forenoone, came there ſome Gentlemen ryding, and ſome Boores running to the King; with advice that the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were lying ſtill in ſeverall Dorps and Villages hard by,<note place="margin">The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice by the way, of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensteins</hi> ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lodging.</note> about <hi>Lutzen;</hi> without any intelligence at all, of the Kings being in motion. This the King being enformed of: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes preſently his high Officers to a Councell of Warre; to adviſe what were beſt to be determined. His Majeſty, even then, (and then firſt) put on the reſolution for fighting: openly ſpeaking it out, <hi>That He now verily ſuppoſed, that God had given his enemies into his hand.</hi> Hô! brave occaſion, ſayes the Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg.</hi> Now God bleſſe us (ſay divers great Officers) tis a happy oportunitie. And truely ſo it was: for divers priſoners (even then brought in, by the Kings Partees, and by the Boores) being by the King exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whither they had any Alarm in their Quarters, of his marching: freely confeſſed that they had none, And ſo much was evident enough, for that they were now ſurprized in their Quarters. Thus thought all the Officers: all being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fall on preſently. And, indeed, there was great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it:<note place="margin">reſolves to fall upon his Quarters.</note> for could the Kings Army have falne in amongſt thoſe villages; he had given a <hi>Camiſado</hi> to ſeverall of their Quarters at once; have cut them off ſingly: for that they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18715:66"/> could never have comne together, to unite their Forces, or have ſuccoured one another. This was evident.</p>
                     <p>And thus neere were 100000 good mens hopes and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, of having arrived to the very higheſt of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: nothing in the whole world being betwixt the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> deſires and his abſolute victory; but the length of the way onely. The Gentlemen and Boores that brought him the Intelligence, told him <hi>Lutzen</hi> was but hard by: which the King was in good hope of, for that He was even then in ſight of it. The Army advanc't ſtoutly, and doubled their march upon it: but their legges found it a longer way then their eyes; it being a ſad <hi>Campagnia;</hi> full eight <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of ground to <hi>Lutzen.</hi> Beſides all this, was there a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Paſſe in the way, at a Bridge over a River; (where but one or two men could goe over a-breaſt) which hindred the Army full two houres going. By this hinderance, was it even night, before the Army could get within two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of <hi>Lutzen:</hi> ſo that had the King (as he ſaid) but two houres more of day-light;<note place="margin">of which victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the length of the way, and ſhortneſſe of the day; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him.</note> 
                        <hi>Walenſtein</hi> (doubtleſſe) had beene <hi>taken Sleeper:</hi> had beene <hi>ex-Imperator'd,</hi> and <hi>un-Generaliſſimo'd.</hi> But God that is both <hi>Ancient of Dayes,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> had otherwiſe diſpoſed of it: Hee had made the way ſo long, and the time ſo ſhort; (no doubt) for a better purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>This ill-fauoured Paſſe, was within two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of <hi>Lutzen:</hi> and in the Village that belonged to it, were there two Imperiall Regiments of Horſe (one of them <hi>Crabats</hi>) enquartered. Theſe having a little notice of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had gotten upon their Horſes, and taken up a high hill on the other ſide of the Paſſe, next to <hi>Lutzen.</hi> They made as though they would have diſturbed the Kings Paſſage; but they did not; the Kings Foot marching fairely over, with ſome Horſe amongſt them. Some of the Kings Foot, were ſtill marching over, till it was darke night, or within it. Thoſe that got over firſt, entertained a ſlight skirmiſh with the Imperiall Horſemen: without any loſſe to the King,<note place="margin">He rowtes two Regiments of the enemies.</note> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome 50. or 100. of them, and taking one <hi>Crabats</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18715:67"/> Enſigne. And now the King taking another hill, (right againſt that, which the Imperialiſts poſſeſſed) he from thence let flye ſome peeces of Ordnance amongſt them: which cauſed them to take the benefit of the night, with ſome confuſion to march off in.</p>
                     <p>This is that Enſigne, ſo much ſpoken of: which had <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> and the <hi>Imperiall Eagle,</hi> depainted upon it. But it is no ſuch raritie; for that moſt (or all) of the <hi>Crabats</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, have the <hi>diſplayed Eagle</hi> for their <hi>bearing.</hi> This was preſented to the King for a faire <hi>Omen;</hi> as if He had already now conquered, both <hi>Fortune</hi> and the <hi>Eagle.</hi> But the King (tis reported) tooke no great content at it: being ſorry (I beleeve) for that the night had prevented him, for taking more of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">and is faine to ſit downe till the morning.</note>And here the King being ſurprized with the darkeneſſe; was forced to ſit downe in the open fields, with his Army: himſelfe lying in his Coach, as other Officers did that had them. Here lay he all night in <hi>Battaglia:</hi> every Regiment lying downe, in the ſame order that they had marched, with their Armes by them. The Pikemen, they ſtucke up their Pikes an-end by them: and every <hi>Rott,</hi> (that is every ſixe) of Muskettiers bringing their Muskets to their <hi>Rottmaſter:</hi> he ſet them right up with their mouthes upward, and bound them together with a peece of Match: where they ſtood ready at hand, for all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The Imperiall Army was in a terrible <hi>Hubub,</hi> at the Kings comming over the Paſſe: for now was the Alarm ſent in hot, to all the ſeverall Dorps and Quarters, even from <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> unto <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Leipſich.</hi> Order upon paine of death was given, for every man with all ſpeed poſſible; to repaire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lutzen,</hi> to their <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi> Preſently upon this, began all the Regiments to draw together; ſome of which, were all night upon their marches: and ſome Horſe that were Quartered very farre off, being not able to reach up, till ten a clocke next morning. And thus (even then) diſt the miſt ſo long keepe off the King next morning, till his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18715:67"/> enemies could be made ſtrong enough for him.</p>
                     <p>As every Regiment came in, ſo were they put into order: which continued all night long; as the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (then priſoners there) obſerved. About ten at night, did <hi>Walenſtein</hi> begin to thinke of the places moſt advantageous, for the planting of his Ordnance: ſome of which, having mounted upon the <hi>Wind-mill hills;</hi> he then began to caſt up a trench of earth about them. All night and next morning, his Dragooners and Pioners, wrought with their Spades about the High-way; and to make the Ditches, or Draine by it, ſerve them for a Breſt-worke, to lodge their Muskettiers in. And this was their worke too, all the next miſty morning; which fatall weather gave them alſo the more reſpite, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their feares and wearineſſes; and to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their unconquered enemy. And thus was the night (the laſt night to ſome thouſands) overpaſſed.</p>
                     <p>The King now over the Paſſe, had put himſelfe into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of fighting: and being thus engaged, the ſooner he fought, the better: for that his enemy ſhould be the leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him. The <hi>Bride,</hi> therefore; more longd not for her wedding morning, nor ſlept leſſe, then the King that night did. Tueſday, (that fatall 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November) at laſt began to draw neere: and alas! it came all to early. A gentle miſt, as if fore-dooming how blacke a day it would be; did his good will to have kept it night ſtill: and the Sunne, as if his great eye had before-hand over-read the fatality of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, ſeemed very loath to have begunne it. So ſweet a correſpondencie (though ſecret) and ſo ſenſible a compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betwixt Gods more noble inſtruments, there is; that the <hi>day</hi> had rather have beene no <hi>day,</hi> then become <hi>Guſtavus</hi> his <hi>laſt day:</hi> and the <hi>Sunne</hi> had rather have conceal'd his owne glory, then his fellow <hi>Guſtavus beames,</hi> ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. But the martiall King, even forcing himſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Time, and haſten on mortality; would needs make thoſe clocks and larums of the warres, his fatall Drummes, to beate two houres before day-light. <hi>Arme, Arme, Repaire
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18715:68"/> to your Colours, keepe your Orders, ſtand to your Armes:</hi> theſe were the morning ſummons, to awaken the heartie ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; from a cold, a hard, and an earthly lodging. The Armie was eaſie to be put in order, for that the moſt part of it, had laine, and ſlept in <hi>Battaglia.</hi> One while, was the King pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have advanc't, and falne on preſently: but the warre being <hi>Gods cauſe;</hi> he would, like <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Himſelfe,</hi> firſt aske counſell of the <hi>God of Battells:</hi> and at leaſt recommend <hi>His owne cauſe</hi> unto <hi>Him.</hi> The Drummes having beaten the firſt March, Hee cauſed prayers to be read to himſelfe, by his owne Chaplaine <hi>Doctor Fabritius:</hi> and where there were <hi>Miniſters</hi> at hand, the ſame was done thorow every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army.</p>
                     <p>The morning proved ſo miſtie, that it was not poſſible to ſee which way to march; nor where to find an enemie to ſtrike at. And this (vnluckily) ſtaid the Kings thoughts, from advancing preſently. This was a fogge of advantage, unto <hi>Walenſtein:</hi> who purpoſing but to ſtand his ground; (which by working all night about the ditch and high-way, his Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had made more troubleſome to be aſſaulted) was now reſolued; that if he muſt fight, he would there abide the firſt ſhocke: and no way to ſeeke the Battell, or to mooue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Adverſarie.</p>
                     <p>About 8. a clocke, the miſt brake up: and (but for one miſchance in it) promiſed as faire a day, as ever was 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November.

                     <p>All this Imperiall Order of embatteling, I have preſented in one mighty <hi>Front:</hi> ſo, namely, as it appeared to the Kings people, and to him that tooke the <hi>Figure</hi> of it: ſince (very largely) cut and imprinted in <hi>Copper,</hi>

                     <p>Having thus deſcribed the <hi>Order;</hi> the <hi>Field</hi> of the <hi>Battell</hi> would next be conſidered of. The King had a North-Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly march of it, from <hi>Naumburg</hi> towards <hi>Lutzen:</hi> ſo that the riſing Sunne was ſomething within a while, favourable. The wind, alſo, (that little that was) blew fairely for him: ſo that the King very ioyfully ſpake it, I thanke God I have both wind and Sunne to favour me.</p>
                     <p>The Countrey was a goodly vaſt levell and <hi>Campagnia,</hi> as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18715:70"/> Corne-lands could be; even,<note place="margin">The field de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> as farre almoſt as the eye could roave over. And yet was the place of Battell ſubiect to as many accidents (and <hi>Walenſtein</hi> was Maſter of them all) as a plaine countrey almoſt could be. The King, right in his way of advancing, had a wet ditch (made by hand) called the <hi>Floſſgraben,</hi> cut traverſe to him: ſo that he was faine to edge about to the Right, with his whole Army; to paſſe by it: and then to edge as much to the left againe, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe right before the enemy. The Imperiall Army was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batteled all along beyond a broad high-way, which led from <hi>Lutzen</hi> unto <hi>Leipſich.</hi> On this ſide of this, was there a kind of broade draine or ditch, which ſerved for bounding and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ploughed lands, and to keepe withall, the High-way the dryer.<note place="margin">Advantageous for <hi>Walenstein.</hi>
                        </note> This had <hi>Walensteins</hi> Pioners beſtowed ſome coſt upon: ſo that putting ſome commanded Muskettiers downe into it, it ſerved them as well as a <hi>Trench</hi> or <hi>Brest-worke.</hi> This was ſo troubleſome for the Kings Horſemen, that many of them were overturned and left behind, in the getting over to charge <hi>Walenſtein:</hi> for indeed there were divers gaps tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it, which the Horſe iuſtling for, overturned one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ground alſo, behind the ditch, had 2. little riſings: and thoſe did <hi>Walenſtein</hi> make choiſe of, for the planting of thoſe Peeces, marked with the letter <hi>F,</hi> in the <hi>Figure.</hi> That Part of the High-way alſo towards <hi>Lutzen;</hi> had an old <hi>Trench</hi> or dry ditch, drawne to it; which being nothing of it ſelfe, but a <hi>Boundary</hi> for lands; that alſo did <hi>Walenſtein</hi> put Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers into: which ſerved them like the High-way ditch, for a <hi>Parapet</hi> or <hi>Brest-worke.</hi> This is markt with the<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gallobelgicus Figure</hi> of the <hi>Battell,</hi> hath omitted this <hi>Trench.</hi> He hath alſo turned the <hi>Highway</hi> wrong</note> letter <hi>H.</hi> A pretty diſtance beyond the High-way, neere unto the Towne of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> (markt with <hi>D,</hi>) were there 3. or 4 <hi>Wind-mills:</hi> amongſt which, the letter <hi>E</hi> ſtandeth. Behind theſe, had <hi>Walenſtein</hi> lodged ſome Muskettiers: and the <hi>Mill-hills</hi> ſerved as naturall <hi>Batteries</hi> for him to plant 9. peeces of Ordnance upon. Betweene the <hi>Mills</hi> and the towne, were there divers gardens with mudd-walls round about them: and in theſe alſo, (in one of them 300. being after found
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18715:71"/> dead) had he cauſed Muskettiers to be placed. <hi>Leipſich</hi> High-way, as it went ſloaping along: ſo had he cauſed his men to bend and hang towards it.</p>
                     <p>And now to the Action. The Sunne having by 9. a clockc cleerely diſpeld the Fogge; it prov'd as promiſing a morning, as ever was 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November: and that commendation ſhould our <hi>Almanacks</hi> have hereafter given it, but for one miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in it. And now the King ſhot his <hi>loſing</hi> or <hi>warning-peece;</hi> and ſo advanced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The King advances.</note>Being paſſed the <hi>Floſſ-graben:</hi> He left alſo the Dorp of <hi>Churſitz</hi> behind him: betwixt which and his Army, he left his Coach and Ammunition-wagons: of which there were not aboue 100 at moſt: the King having left the reſt at <hi>Naum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> with no purpoſe of fighting. The King advanced, till he came with the end of his <hi>Right Wing,</hi> within Musket ſhot of a little wood: having all the way a full view of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Army.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Walenſtein</hi> much over-powred the King in numbers; may appeare by the mighty long <hi>Front</hi> that he put out; full 2. <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles, from one <hi>Wings</hi> end to another. This is alſo to be conſidered:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Walenſteins</hi> numbers much more then the Kings.</note> that <hi>Walenſteins</hi> (and all the old) <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> is to march 10. deepe in <hi>File:</hi> whereas the King, was no more but 6. deepe: of <hi>Foote</hi> (I meane:) and of <hi>Horſe,</hi> but 3. or 4. deepe: according as the <hi>Brigades</hi> were either ſtronger or weaker. Beſides this, that <hi>Walenſteins Files</hi> were all the way almoſt as deepe againe; his <hi>Ranks</hi> alſo were in <hi>Front</hi> ſo much longer:<note place="margin">The King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to lengthen out his Right Wing</note> that the King was faine to ſend for <hi>Bulach,</hi> and all the <hi>Squadrons</hi> of Horſe, from the <hi>Right Wing</hi> of the <hi>Reere</hi> or <hi>ſecond Front</hi> to imp out his Feathers at the end of his <hi>Right Wing:</hi> for feare that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him. Theſe <hi>Squadrons</hi> when Generall-Major <hi>Knip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen</hi> miſſed out of their places; he ſent a Gentleman to his Maieſty: to know whither he had otherwiſe employed them? The King was at the ſame time, likewiſe; ſending the the Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg</hi> unto <hi>Kniphauſen;</hi> to tell him, that he would but uſe them in that firſt charge; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18715:71"/> them backe againe to their <hi>Order.</hi> The Duke meeting with the Gentleman, and telling him thus much: both then returned to their places.</p>
                     <p>The King wondred not a little at it, when he ſaw how faire a <hi>Clew Walenſtein</hi> ſpread: affirming to theſe about him; That if he had any <hi>Seconds</hi> behind his firſt <hi>Front;</hi> he could not iudge him to be leſſe then 30000. True it is indeed, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> had given out <hi>Proviant Comiſſions</hi> for 40000. and ſometimes for 50000. people: but yet had he not ſo many fighting men: for that there were at leaſt 10000. women, ſervants, children, and ſuch Hang-byes, belonging to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which are to be diſcounted. Beſides this, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> had but one <hi>Front,</hi> and the King 2. ſo that we may well allow <hi>Walenſtein</hi> to be 20000. in the <hi>Firſt Front:</hi> at the very firſt ordering of the <hi>Battell.</hi> After which, accounting thoſe that were ſtill comming in, even till 10. a clocke; and <hi>Pappenheims</hi> Horſe and Dragooners, which came in about one or two a clocke: and his Foot, thought to make the ſecond fierce charge towards night: and then (doubtleſſe) theſe could not be fewer then 10. on 12000. which made up in all, full 30000. fighting men.</p>
                     <p>The Armies being comne within Cannon ſhot, the great Ordnance, began to play one upon another, terribly. The Aire roar'd, and the earth trembled: and thoſe manly hearts that feared not dying, were yet very loath to have no more play for their lives, then to be beaten to pieces, with the bullet of a Cannon. And here had <hi>Walenſtein,</hi> ſurely, a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the Kings Army:<note place="margin">The Battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with great Ordnance.</note> for his Ordnance being all ready planted upon ſteaddy and fixt Batteries: the Canoniers tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed their Peeces, and delivered their bullets with more aime, then the Kings men could poſſibly: who gave fire in motion ſtill, and advancing. His Maieſties Cannon, ever as a peece was diſcharged, was there left to be brought after: the Army ſtill advancing, and marching away from it. Plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the King liked not this ſport: for that the Imperiall Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non did his men farre more ſpoile and execution; then he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18715:72"/> could againe returne them. Seeing therefore no good to be done this way, he cauſes his Army to advance upon the very mouth of the Cannon, and to charge towards the <hi>High-way,</hi> and to beate out thoſe Muskettiers, that were lodged in it.</p>
                     <p>The Imperiall Army ſtood their ground all this time; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the fierceneſſe of their enemies charge, would indifferently well be abated, by that time they had beaten out thoſe Muskettiers, and had put themſelues out of order and breath, with ſcambling over the ditches. And indeed the place being almoſt mans height, a many of the Kings Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were there left tumbling up and downe; but of the reſt that gat over, this was the order of their Charge. The <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Muskettiers,</hi> and the <hi>Foote</hi> of the <hi>Swedes Brigade</hi> having cleered the <hi>High-way:</hi> the whole <hi>Front</hi> advanced to charge together.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And iuſt now, fell the miſt: the Sunne, who before ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo brightly, (even almoſt from the height of his <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> it being now paſt a 11. a clocke) on the ſudden muffling up his face in a mourning Cloud: as if not able to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the falling King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> ſeeing the King fall, and his men beaten backe, gaue all for loſt preſently: ſhifting himſelfe withall out of the Battell, unto <hi>Weiſſenfells.</hi> This made him to be ſo ill ſpoken of,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Saxon Lawen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> gets him out of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</note> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole Armie; and to be cenſured for worſe then cowardiſe: the ſouldiers not ſparing to charge treacherie upon him. But this ſcandall, thoſe that better knew him haue thus excuſed. The troth is, that he had beene at <hi>Vienna</hi> till the end of Iune before: had ſince that time ſerued the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts; and was but a fortnight or three weekes ſince, comne into the Kings Armie. So that he fearing all loſt, gatt him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18715:74"/> out of the Battell unto <hi>Weiſſenfels;</hi> that he might have this to anſwer to the Imperialiſts, ſhould they become victorious; that he was not at all in the Battell. But hearing, that night, how the <hi>Swediſh</hi> had the victory; he was by 4. a clocke next morning in the field, as forward as the formoſt. However, he was the man that firſt gave abroad the rumour, that the King was kild: and by him was it ſooner knowne in <hi>Weiſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels,</hi> then in the Kings owne Army. This Duke finding no employment, after the Battell, nor great good will among the Army towards him: went after 2. or 3. dayes, to his Couſin the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony;</hi> who ſent him to the Army in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and there he is now <hi>Felt-Marſhall,</hi> unto <hi>Lieftenant-Generall Arnheim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this while, are the Imperialiſts maſters of the Kings body; and of the ground they had beaten the <hi>Swediſh</hi> from. They had the King, I ſay, in their poſſeſſion; and there they ſtript him firſt of all:<note place="margin">The King ſtript</note> every man being greedy to get ſome part of his ſpoyles, that they might hereafter glory to have taken it, from the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Some got his Spurres: one of which, had the buckle broken of it: a common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier got his Sword, another his Ring, which was preſented to <hi>Holck:</hi> his Buff-coate, his Hat, and other parts of his cloaths; all were now pillaged from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, by the Imperialiſts.</note>And this greedineſſe of the ſouldiers, (every man to get ſomething) was one of the cauſes that his body was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, and kept for ranſome. Another reaſon for which might be, that every man beleeved him not to be the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> for notwithſtanding that himſelfe told them he was the King: yet divers (for all that) ſuſpected him rather to be ſome great man, that ſaid ſo to ſave his owne life: as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rather to be taken priſoner.</p>
                     <p>Severall reports there went abroad the Army, of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his manner of dying. Some relate it thus, that one <hi>Truckſes</hi> who waited upon the King in his chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe falne downe wounded beſides the King (and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought off alive) was demanded by an Officer of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18715:74"/> enemies, Who the King was? and that asking the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the King, he ſhould anſwere <hi>That he was the King of Sweden;</hi> whereupon he thruſt him thorow the body with a broad ſword, and then ranne away: for that the <hi>Swedes</hi> now charged. Not much varying from this, is the Letter of <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Keſel,</hi> Preacher vnto Duke <hi>Bernard:</hi> who names one <hi>Loebelfinger</hi> (a young Gentleman) in ſtead of <hi>Truckses.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This <hi>Loebelfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> is ſonne to Colonell <hi>Loe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belfinger</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg:</hi> who was now ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, indeed, unto the Lord Marſhall <hi>Crail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham:</hi> and ſo very likely to be neere the Kings Perſon.</note> Adding that ſome Horſemen of the enemies a-lighting to ſtrip the dead bodies, askt the King who he was; who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>I am the King of Sweden; who doe ſeale the Religion and Libertie of the Germane Nation, with my blood.</hi> After which ſubjoyning, <hi>Alas my poore Queene! and commending his ſoule to God;</hi> they then kill'd this dying Conquerour.

That there is a difference in the names, is an eaſie miſtake: eſpecially ſo ſuddenly after that huddle. <hi>Truckses</hi> might report it from <hi>Loebelfinger;</hi>

This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie is very much ſtrengthened, by the Imperiall ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers owne report of it, made at <hi>Prague</hi> to thoſe Gentlemen of our nation, then priſoners there. How, namely, that the King being firſt wounded and in his retreat purſued by them, would as they offered to ſhoot and ſtrike at him, call out and ſay, <hi>That hee was the King of Sweden.</hi> My <hi>Spaniſh Relation</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:18715:75"/> addes this to it. In the beginning of the encounter, one <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Bucela,</hi> Comrade to Colonel <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> knew the King, as he lay wounded and dying upon the ground: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of giving <hi>Piccolomini</hi> notice,<note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts goe to ſee the dying King.</note> he with ten more went to ſee the Body, which was yet quivering: and whileſt they were about to bring it away; a troope of the enemies charging, forced them to retire and leave it. The noiſe of his death, was preſently diſperſed abroad: but yet beleefe was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to it, for that ſome priſoners affirmed that he was but hurt, and carryed in a cloſe Coach, following his white Enſigne. Thus farre my <hi>Spaniard.</hi> All this might be true. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> priſoners that reported him to be but wounded: were thoſe that were taken ſo ſoone as ever he offered to retreat: and before he was ſhot the ſecond time. But that they ſaid he was carryed off in his Coach, &amp;c. was their Iudgement: that being wounded, it was likely he would goe off in his Coach, which at firſt ſtood behind the <hi>White Regiment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What, now, if putting all theſe together, we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Piccolomini</hi> himſelfe and his Company,<note place="margin">A conjecture:</note> to be the men, that thus queſtioned and wounded, the dying King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?</hi> Was it for meerely charging with his Regiment, when the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was firſt ſhot, that <hi>Walenſtein</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beſtowed as much Lands in <hi>Bohemia</hi> upon him, as he was offered 400000 Dollars for, which amounts to 100000 pound <hi>Sterling?</hi> But this I make but a ſuſpition, no accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor have I heard it from <hi>Prague,</hi> that <hi>Piccolomini</hi> ſhould thus uſe him.</p>
                     <p>Paſt conjecture it is, that he who could not be conquered, was there ſlaine, and for the principall manner, in this very faſhion: in the poſſibility and circumſtances whereof, I for mine owne part doe reſt ſatisfied. His death was knowne but to ſome few, of the great ones, (no not to thoſe of his owne <hi>Army</hi> or <hi>Wing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Kings death concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from his owne Army.</note>) for 24 houres after: all beleeving, what was either by <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Error,</hi> given out; how that hee was but carryed off wounded. Hence it is, that the Letters written the very ſame night, ſpeake ſo doubtfully of his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18715:75"/> death; or ſo hopefully of his life: and that thoſe few words, which He is reported to have ſpoken, when he lay on the ground a dying; were after miſtaken to be uttered at <hi>Weiſſenfels,</hi> in that 6 houres, or 36 houres, which hee was ſaid to have lived. The <hi>Royall Corps;</hi> was after a quarter of an houre, recovered by Colonell <hi>Stolhanſhe:</hi> and in an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition wagon (out of which the powder was purpoſely ſhifted) was it privately carryed out of the Field unto <hi>Weiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenfels:</hi> for that his Coach was runne away among others,<note place="margin">The Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> in the fright which the <hi>Crabats</hi> lately put the wagons to. And this long inſertion concerning the manner of the Kings death, I confeſſe to be rather <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> then <hi>methodicall:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Authors excuſe.</note> an <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> (I know) would rather have referred all this, unto the latter end of the Combate. But for that I have ſtill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how curiouſly inquiſitive men have beene, after the manner of the Kings death: I ſuppoſed that an indeavour to give content, in that kinde, would be no unſeaſonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtraction; (though the very heate and fierceſt of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in other parts, be a while deferred) to thoſe that ſo much longed for it: yea more, then for any other part of the <hi>Story.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Returne we now into the <hi>Battell,</hi> and to the <hi>Right Wing</hi> againe. The miſt that we before told you of; was not (by their owne ſide) judged to be any way prejudiciall, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous rather unto the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> ſeeing that the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts who had now the better of it, were by the falling of this Miſt ſo arreſted, as that they purſued not the Retreat, which they had put the <hi>Swediſh</hi> unto. The rumour likewiſe of the Kings death, made them ſo to clutter about the <hi>Body;</hi> that that alſo ſtayed them.</p>
                     <p>All this while were the foure Foot <hi>Brigades</hi> of the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Battell, <hi>pell mell</hi> at it:<note place="margin">The Second charge.</note> and they (even by my <hi>Spaniards</hi> confeſſion) gat ground a-pace of thoſe Imperialiſts whom they had attacked. And now alſo did <hi>Stolhanſhe</hi> (who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had an <hi>Item</hi> given him of the Kings death, or great danger, by <hi>Crailſham, Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> or ſome other)
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18715:76"/> charge ſo fiercely toward that very place,<note place="margin">The Kings body recovered</note> that he beate off the Imperialiſts, recovered the Kings Body: which he brought off naked; after it had beene a full quarter of an houre in the enemies poſſeſſion. And now was <hi>Piccolominies</hi> Regiment ſoundly peppered: the <hi>Swediſh</hi> both Foote and Horſe after an houres fight, beating all the Imperialiſts along before them; till they had driven them to the very gallowes, which you ſee behind them. And now did the <hi>Swediſh</hi> get poſſeſſion of theſe 7.<note place="margin">and the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts beaten to the gallowes</note> peeces of Ordnance which you ſee together at the letter <hi>F,</hi> under the number 50. which was <hi>Piccolominies</hi> Horſe Regiment. Theſe Ordnance were the eaſier to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for that they played not, <hi>Walenſteins</hi> Powder-Wagons were by miſchance blowne up ſo that his Cannon were ſcarce heard of, all the day after.</p>
                     <p>And thus ended the <hi>ſecond Charge:</hi> for by this time was the miſt becomne ſo extraordinary, and by the ſmoake ſo thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the <hi>Swedes</hi> could not ſee how to purſue their adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. And here was the miſt, becomne as beneficiall to the Imp. as it had been favourable before, unto the <hi>Swediſh.</hi> In this time fell there ſo terrible an affrightment in the Imperiall Army; that 1000. or 1500. <hi>Dutch Horſe,</hi> ranne all away together. One of them was by a Gentleman of our nation (then priſoner in their Reere) over-heard to ſay: Oh, I know the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> well enough, I have ſerved him; he's beſt at the latter end of a day. But the chiefeſt fright was among the Ladyes, the Captaines wives, and other women, then behind the Army. Many Gentlewomen gat out of their Coaches, cut aſunder the harneſſe, and mounted ſtradlings upon the bare horſe backs, and away they ſpudded among the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Now went the Wagon-horſes and the Ordnance-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to it; all were ridden away with. Divers women and children, were there trodden to death: nor would the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men turne head, notwithſtanding they heard the charge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently againe renewed, and thoſe about the <hi>Mills,</hi> all this time at it: till they were gotten over a Paſſe, 4. or 5. <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the place of Battell. The fright ſo purſued them, though no body elſe did: that comming to this Paſſe, the Officers
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18715:76"/> drew out their ſwords, and ſlaſht and beate off the ſouldiers, to give them way to get over it. There were at leaſt 4. or 5000. people of them, and they quartered themſelves confuſedly up and downe in the villages which the Boores had forſaken: nor durſt they ever returne into the Battell. Amongſt theſe was my Author carried away: from whom I learned it.<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>After a little pauſe, the Count of <hi>Pappenheim</hi> with his Horſe and Dragooners, arrived; whom ſome will needs have, to have beene in perſon at the beginning of the battell. By his comming, was the charge thereabouts renewed. He put himſelfe into the Imperiall <hi>Left Wing,</hi> (which was moſt diſtreſſed, and which had beene reſerved for him:) to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Swediſh Right Wing;</hi> where he ſuppoſed the King in perſon had commanded.<note place="margin">is ſlaine.</note> Iuſt as he was ordering his Horſe, he was ſtrucke with a bullet of a <hi>Falconet,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Sling-peece</hi> about the ſhoulder; of which he died preſently: even ſo ſoone as he was taken downe from his horſe, to have beene carried unto <hi>Leipſich.</hi> This was a brave fighting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: whoſe body was by <hi>Walenſtein</hi> carried unto <hi>Prague;</hi> where it was to be ſeene publickely. The Emperour (as a little <hi>French Relation</hi> that I have, affirmeth) had newly ſent the <hi>Collar of the Golden Fleece</hi> unto him and <hi>Walenſtein:</hi> which honour, before ever he received; he was in the place where he ſhould have worne his <hi>Order,</hi> thus dubbed with a <hi>Sling-peece.</hi> He had make his <hi>Will,</hi> a little before: had ſhryven himſelfe and communicated at a <hi>dry-Maſſe:</hi> and made this ſhort <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon it. His <hi>Soule,</hi> he commended to <hi>God;</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> (if he were ſlaine) to the Emperour: and his wife and children, unto <hi>Walenſtein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He being ſhot, his Officers flocking about him,<note place="margin">His men run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning quite away upon it.</note> were heard to cry, ô our Generall is ſlaine, our Generall is ſlaine: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately whereupon his Horſe turned head, and ran out of the Battell without ſtroke-ſtriking; backe againe towards the <hi>Weſer</hi> and the <hi>Lower Saxony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Walsteiners,</hi> whom <hi>Pappenheims</hi> comming had ſet on; fell to it cloſely: <hi>Piccolomini</hi> advanced, and <hi>Terſica,</hi>

And now began the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the longeſt, and the obſtinateſt conflict; that had beene, ſince the King was killed. The charge was ſuſtained by the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> with much gallantry: and never was Battell better foughten: nor ſeldome have <hi>Battalions</hi> ever ſtood, amongſt whom ſo much ſpoyle hath beene committed. Full 2. houres, were they in hote Battell.<note place="margin">A terrible onſet</note> On ths Imperiall ſide was <hi>Picco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,</hi> twice or thrice, ſhot; Sergeant Major <hi>Bruner,</hi> ſlaine; and ſo was a young Count of <hi>Walenſtein;</hi> and if the old one were there, I wonder how he ſcap't pelting. The <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Fulda,</hi> was at this charge alſo ſlaine: and thinke, then, how many Officers and common ſouldiers, was it likely that theſe great Commanders did take along, to waite upon them into the next world.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide, the chiefe of the ſpoyle light upon the 2. middlemoſt <hi>Brigades</hi> of Foote belonging unto <hi>Grave Neeles</hi> and Colonell <hi>Winckle:</hi> which you ſee at the numbers 9. and 10. The Imperialiſts charged with ſo much fury, and with <hi>Battalions</hi> of 2. or 3000. in a Regiment: that they by fine force drove the <hi>Swediſh</hi> to the retreate, in the plaine field; and (as the moſt ſay) even then recovered their 7. peeces of Ordnance. <hi>Grave Neeles,</hi> Colonell of the <hi>Life-guards</hi> (which is the <hi>yellow Regiment</hi>) was there ſhot a little above the knee: of which being carried off ſpoyled, he after dyed. Out of this <hi>Brigade,</hi> did the Imperialiſts carry away 7.

He that had carryed the Colours, was after ſeene with his ſword in his hand: but his <hi>clowte</hi> was miſſing.</p>
                     <p>Colonell <hi>Winckles Blew Regiment,</hi> likewiſe; found as hard treatment. Himſelfe (brave man) was ſhot in the arme a little above the elbow, and in the hand; and carried out of the Battell. His Lieftenant <hi>Caſpar Wolff,</hi> was ſlaine upon the place, and moſt of his Colours taken. Theſe 2. <hi>Brigades,</hi> were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18715:77"/> of the flower of the Army: old ſouldiers of 7. or 8. yeeres ſervice, (the moſt of them) and whom the King had there placed, for that he moſt relied on them. Theſe <hi>old Blades,</hi> ſtood to their Armes, ſtoutly; and the adverſe writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, That their dead bodies now covered the ſame ground, which living they had defended. Theſe were old <hi>beaten ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> indeed, but it was ſo long ſince they had beene laſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; that they had by this time forgotten how to runne away. This is the reaſon that they were ſo ſhattered: that when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night, they were to have falne on againe: both theſe <hi>Brigades</hi> put together, could not make one Squadron ſtrong: which is but the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. part of one of them. By this you ſee, that 5. of 6. were there killed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Swedes Brigade,</hi> marked with the number 8. fared ſomething better; becauſe neere unto the Horſe: and yet there came not aboue 400. off, alive or unwounded. Duke <hi>Bernards Brigade,</hi> marked with 11; was ſomething more out of Gun-ſhot: for that next the Horſe of the <hi>Left Wing.</hi> Yet here was Colonel <hi>Wildeſtein</hi> ſhot in the breaſt, of which he after died: Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Lieftenant-Colonel <hi>Winckler,</hi> being ſlaine upon the place. In this ſore bickering, the ſpoyle on the Imperiall ſide, fell moſtly upon old <hi>Bruners</hi> and young <hi>Walenſteins</hi> Regiments, both which were here killed; with full halfe, if not 2 thirds of the ſouldiers. Theſe Regiments performed their duties ſo valiantly, and <hi>Walenſtein</hi> himſelfe tooke ſuch ſpeciall notice of them; that he along time after (if not ſtill) maintained them in his owne houſe at <hi>Prague</hi> for it. <hi>Hinderſons Reſerve</hi> of Foote, in the meane time, which you ſee at number 37. had alſo their ſhare in the knocking: one of the Offices and uſes of the <hi>Reſerve</hi> being, ſtill to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſecond where moſt need is; with freſh men to derne up the holes, and ſtop up the gaps of the ſlaughtered. And whereas thoſe 4. <hi>Brigades</hi> of the <hi>Van</hi> had ſo terribly beene ſhattered; Generall-Major <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> had out of his care ſent up theſe 2. <hi>Brigades</hi> of the Count of <hi>Thurn,</hi> and the Colonell <hi>Mitzlaff,</hi> which you ſee at numbers 28. and 29.

The diſtance of his <hi>Reere</hi> from the <hi>Front,</hi> was about 600. paces: and at that ſcantling he ſtill kept himſelfe, behind the other.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an</hi> were diſordered and put to the retreate; they with him, ſtill, found a whole great Body together, unbroken, by the ſight, of which they reſumed new courage, and were ſet in order againe.</p>
                     <p>And very glad was Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> when in the next break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Miſt, he came and found <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> in ſo good order; whom (as he openly profeſſed) he feared to have found all to pieces. For now, betwixt 3. and 4. a clocke, (which was a little before Sun-ſet) did the Miſt breake up; and there was a faire halfe-houre after it. At which time Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> going abroad, to over-view the poſture and countenance of the Army: (which ſince his hearing of the Kings death, the miſt and ſmoake had not ſuffered him to diſcover any thing of:) he came now along by the <hi>Battell</hi> unto the <hi>Right Wing;</hi> ſpeaking to the Officers and ſouldiers, and encouraging them to a new on-ſet. Plainely he found the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18715:79"/> whole Army (except <hi>Kniphauſens</hi> part) in no very good order: which he and <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> (who tooke much good paines likewiſe about it) did their beſt to reduce them to. When the <hi>Word</hi> was given for a new <hi>Charge:</hi> alas <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> (ſaid the poore ſouldiers one to another) muſt we fall on againe! Come ſaies the tother (embracing him,) Courage; if we muſt, lets doe it bravely, and make a day out.

                        </note> And here (as my <hi>Spaniſh Relator</hi> ſaies) did the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi> light upon a ſlight fillipp: by a favourable Musket bullet, namely, which made no wound; but left a blue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance onely upon him. That hee was indeed ſhot thorow the Coate, was at <hi>Prague</hi> reported: though ſome would even there ſay privately, that he was in no ſuch danger.</p>
                     <p>And now were the Imperialiſts beaten round about, even to the very <hi>Wind-Mills:</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> being Maſters of the ground, that they ſhouldred the others out of. But iuſt now a little before Sun-ſet, fell the fatall miſt againe: which ſo haſtned on the night, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> could not well ſee, which way to purſue their enemies. Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> in his comming backe was thus heard to ſay, Mercifull God! but for this miſt, we had even now gotten the victory. Hence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18715:79"/> went he backe againe over all the <hi>Battalians,</hi> his owne <hi>Poſt</hi> againe: towards which, he now perceived the Imperialiſts to be making.</p>
                     <p>And now by Sunne-ſetting, was all the Field cleere of the Imperialiſts, excepting onely about the <hi>Wind-Mills:</hi> and there, plainely, were both <hi>Coloredoes</hi> and Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> men, falne off one from another: like 2. <hi>Duellers</hi> leaning on their ſwords, to take breath againe. Certainely, they had ſo bangd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that neither of both were in order: but either party ſhot at adventure right forward, and let the bullet find his owne way, as it could, thorow that night of ſmoake and miſtineſſe. Thoſe Muskettiers which (we told you) were lodged in the mudd-wal'd gardens, were ſeene to give fire, give fire, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: but no men to be diſcerned. And the <hi>Swedes</hi> at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhot at them againe: and as at night they got ground, they <hi>ſtormed</hi> into the gardens; as if they had beene ſo many Caſtles, Here the next day, were a many found dead: 300. in one of them.</p>
                     <p>And iuſt in the edge of the evening, when the <hi>Swediſh</hi> well hoped all had beene finiſhed: had Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> freſh word brought him, that <hi>Pappenheims</hi> Foote were even now arrived, from <hi>Hall;</hi> and were beginning a freſh <hi>Charge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. charge.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Wind-Mills.</hi> Thus ranne the <hi>Word</hi> over the Army, <hi>Pappenheims</hi> Foote are comne, <hi>Pappenheims</hi> Foot are comne. This the <hi>Swediſh</hi> beleeved: though Captaine <hi>Feilding</hi> aſſures me, that the Imperialiſts at <hi>Prague,</hi> would never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, that the <hi>Pappenheimers</hi> came at all into the <hi>Battell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now was all the ſervice, (after halfe an houres ſilence on both ſides;) turned unto the <hi>Wind-Mills.</hi> The Imperialiſts courages, like the throwes of a dying body; ſtruggled hard, at the laſt caſt, for life; and made, for the time, as fierce a Charge of it, as any had the day before paſſed. To withſtand this, now does <hi>Kniphauſen</hi> bring on his 2. freſh <hi>Brigades:</hi> with whom are the other 2. of <hi>Thurns</hi> and <hi>Mitzlaffs</hi> conioyned, that he had before ſent to the reliefe of the <hi>Vantguard:</hi> which,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18715:80"/> indeed, had not ſo cruelly beene ſhattered. Now alſo Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> r'allying all the Horſe together, advanced to the <hi>Charge.</hi> The Imperialiſts had, anew, put downe ſome more Muskettiers into the <hi>croſſe ditch</hi> or <hi>Boundary of Lands,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <hi>H:</hi> which not a little troubled the <hi>Swediſh.</hi> Once or twice, did they offer to force that <hi>Trench,</hi> and to <hi>Storme</hi> over it: but it was ſo troubleſome and dangerous in the darke, that they did but over-tumble one another, and were faine to keepe on the other ſide of it, to bring on ſome Muskettiers, and from thence to give their vollyes. The beſt of it was, that it was not above 100. paces diſtant from the <hi>High-way;</hi> cloſe behind which, the Imperialiſts were ranged. That which moſt galled the Imperialiſts, was the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: which on the <hi>Right hand Flancke</hi> of them, and on the neerer ſide of the <hi>High-way;</hi> were now turnd upon them. This moſt cruell and hote fight, continued till about 5. a clock in the euening:<note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts give it over</note> much about which time, the <hi>Walsteiners</hi> or <hi>Pappenheimers</hi> or both together; fell off in the darke, and gave it quite over.</p>
                     <p>And thus ended this long, cruell, bloody, and bravely fought <hi>Battell:</hi> which in continuall exerciſe, in one place or other,<note place="margin">and ſo the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ended.</note> (or at leaſt with ſmall intermiſſions) had laſted from 9. in the morning untill this time. Eight or 9. long houres, was every man in danger of a ſudden death: when at other times, he would have thought himſelfe ill handled; by ſo long a <hi>Fit of an Ague.</hi> I have caſt the whole Battell, into 5. grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more remarkeable <hi>Charges:</hi> not becauſe there were no more, but for that theſe were moſt eminent. And yet, perchance, were not theſe ſo diſtinct <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> that they might be ſaid to have begun iuſt now (becauſe the whole Battell was but one continuall <hi>Charge,</hi> ſome where or other) but for that the greater <hi>Heates</hi> and <hi>Executions;</hi> were much about theſe times, and in thoſe manners, that I have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Theſe <hi>Charges</hi> moſtly concerne the <hi>Battell</hi> and <hi>Right Wing:</hi> for of the <hi>Left,</hi> I have not ſuch particular Intelligence.

Aſſuredly, there hath beene no ſuch cruell Fight, that hath yeelded ſo few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. The Imperialiſts being marcht off; the <hi>Swediſh</hi> (gladder of victory, then of enemies) had neither eyes nor wills good enough, to purſue the <hi>Retreate</hi> upon them: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially over ſuch troubleſome paſſages, as the Ditch, the <hi>High-way,</hi> and its <hi>Ditch:</hi> the <hi>Wind-Mills,</hi> and their Ordnance: and the Gardens with their Muskettiers in them. Nor had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, after ſuch an <hi>afternoones drinking;</hi> any hearty good ſtomacks to ſuch a ſupper, as were likely to coſt them ſuch a <hi>Reckoning.</hi> Beating their Drummes, therefore, after a while; they ſent away their Baggage and Ammunition, and made their retreate towards <hi>Leipſich.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> at firſt hearing of the Imperiall Drummes, knew not what to make of it: but doubted that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies meant to retire into the next Dorps; and what they would doe to morrow, they knew not. Now were Duke <hi>Bernard, Kniphauſen</hi> and ſome others, in conſultation what to doe? Whither to lye all night in the Field, to expect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charge in the morning; or to carry off their ſicke and wounded men, and to retire the Army towards <hi>Weiſſenfels.</hi> Colonel <hi>Hinderſon</hi> had order in the meane time, to burne the carriages of thoſe 11. peeces of Ordnance, which were taken from the Imperialiſts: becauſe in the night time, the <hi>Swedes</hi> deſpaired of drawing them along with them.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Walenſteins</hi> ſelfe had already yeelded up the <hi>Field</hi> (and the <hi>Victory</hi> conſequently) unto the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> and by this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, put an end to their doubtfull conſultation. The <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo,</hi> already upon his retreate to <hi>Leipſich,</hi>) had given order for all the Regiments to follow after him. Hereupon, a Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Horſeman of the Baron of<note n="*" place="margin">Brother to that <hi>Hoffkirch,</hi> that ſerved on the Kings ſide.</note> 
                        <hi>Hoffkirchs</hi> Regiment, was ſent to find his Colonell; and to give him order to goe after the <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi> This Horſeman (it ſo chanced) had in the darke ſtumbled upon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Colonel <hi>Oems Reſerve</hi> of Horſe: which having not beene brought to fight all the day,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18715:82"/> was now ordered to make the <hi>Retreate,</hi> and to keepe the <hi>Watch</hi> for the whole Army. <hi>Qui va là, who goes there?

To him he told, that his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi> was gone to <hi>Leipſich,</hi> and had commanded all to follow him. This being diſcovered to Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Kniphauſen;</hi> they concluded the <hi>Victory</hi> to be their owne, reſolved to keepe the <hi>Field;</hi> and ſent to countermand Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hinderſon;</hi> who had already burnt one or two of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>Carriages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Victory</hi> was then publiſhed thorow out the Army: and <hi>Word</hi> given, to ſtay all night upon the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Battell.</hi> All this night was there a pittifull crying heard, of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wounded on both ſides: none being able to find, know, or relieve his friend or <hi>Camrade</hi> in the darkeneſſe. Twas a froſty cold night: in which many a brave man dyed of the anguiſh of his wounds miſerably; who might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have beene cured: they being frozen to death, by the morrow morning. The <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>dolour</hi> of a <hi>wound,</hi> is the <hi>complaint</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> makes, for a <hi>remedie:</hi> but here alas! the confuſed <hi>complainings</hi> of the wounded, hindred many a man from his friends hearing of him; who might elſe have given him <hi>remedie.</hi>

                     <p>But beſides theſe of the Imperialiſts ſlaine upon the place, the Boores had knockt downe God knowes how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſouldiers (2. or 3000. ſay ſome) as they fled away ſtragling about the Countrey. And the ſouldiers were even with the Boores for it: for that in their flight towards <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia;</hi> ſome would goe out purpoſely upon Partees, to kill Boores: one Captaine being heard to profeſſe, That he had that day kill'd fiftie.

                     <p>True it is, that when 2. dayes the <hi>Swedes</hi> overviewed their Army, they wanted about 4000. of their former numbers: but into thoſe are the wounded to be reckoned, which were not then able to muſter.

Countrimen, were his priſoners; and they ſaw him at <hi>Prague:</hi> and deſcribe him to be, an old beardleſſe man, full of the palſie; a Gentleman of much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, courteſie, and extraordinary hardineſſe of body. As this is true, ſo beleeue the reſt of that Writer, that told you of the death of thoſe great Imperialiſts.</p>
                     <p>The Imperiall Ordnance, whoſe carriages had beene bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; were at the <hi>Swedes</hi> going towards <hi>Weiſſenfels</hi> Novem. 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ſlipt under the Caſtle walls of <hi>Lutzen:</hi> into which they put a garriſon of 200. Muskettiers. For the drawing away of the reſt; every Regiment was charged to take care of one: and to lend horſes for the doing of it. That night went the Kings body to <hi>Weiſſenfels:</hi> where they found themſelues to have gotten but a dolefull and a wofull victory: loſing that incomparable Conqueror, who was alone worth 2. Armies.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18715:83"/> The Rovall Body, was carried to <hi>Naumburg</hi> to be embalmed:<note place="margin">The Kings Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed:</note> after which when the Armies went againe into the field, the dead King was carried along in his Chariot, marching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Horſe and the Foot, in the middle of the Army. This ſo long continued, untill upon the comming of the Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtiern,</hi> the <hi>Corps</hi> was ſent with a mourning Convoye towards <hi>Spandaw,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">is convoyed into <hi>Spandaw.</hi>
                        </note> in his Brother of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> country. And thus dyed this <hi>great Deliverer:</hi> which is a higher and a more holy Title, then that of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.</hi> Thus dyed he with a victory: which, had he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but 3. dayes longer, he had obtained without a Battell. So confident was the enemy that he never durſt have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; that the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> had even already given out Orders, for the diſperſing of his Army to their winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This is ſure: for beſides that it is intimated in my <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Relation;</hi> the Imperialiſts themſelues freely at <hi>Prague</hi> confeſſed it. Then had he falne in among them, as he thought to have done, the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November. But he is dead: and that as heartily bemoaned of the <hi>Germanes,</hi> (to ſay of no more) as of his owne Subiects: who yet profeſſe their loſſe to be unſpeakeable. And in both their <hi>Chronicles</hi> ſhall his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>memory</hi> be made <hi>immortall:</hi> and his <hi>Name</hi> ſhall ever live in their <hi>mouths, glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Speake we now a little, of the diſtemper in the Imperiall Army. When <hi>Walenſtein</hi> firſt beate his Drummes, to retreate to <hi>Leipſich:</hi> he had purpoſed to have made no more then a faire retreate indeed of it. But no ſooner did his men heare that <hi>ſignall:</hi> but they fell to running preſently, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting further order for their <hi>Rendez-vous.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The flight, and wonderfull confuſion among the Imperialiſts.</note> This fright was ſo great, that the moſt of them never came in order againe, till they recovered into <hi>Bohemia:</hi> yea even there, full three weekes after the Battell; were there divers multitudes of ſouldiers, and ſome almoſt whole Enſignes ſeene; then firſt enquiring after their fled Colonels: who had not yet ſeen their owne Regiments. And this was not onely ſo, with a great many ſtraglers; but even amongſt thoſe that were neereſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18715:84"/> about the <hi>Generaliſſimo:</hi> there was not a Regiment (ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all) that marcht or Quartered in any order; but ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly up and downe in Dorps, as every man ſhifted. Once did our Countrimen (that were carried away among them) ſee 25. <hi>Colours</hi> of them together: but this was in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> and the greateſt ſhow that they had till that time ſeene of them.</p>
                     <p>Divers Officers confeſſed, that they had loſt 6000. men: which others made more nice of, and profeſſed to have loſt but 4000.<note place="margin">Their owne confeſſions of the Battell.</note> And as freely withall did they confeſſe, that had the <hi>Swedes</hi> but ſent off 1000. freſh Horſe after them, they might have cut all the whole Army to peeces. When in their <hi>Flight, (Retreate</hi> is now too faire a word for them) they came at night to any Quarter; their cuſtome was to ſtay ſtill there, till ſome <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe were heard of, or diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to purſue them: of which though there appeared but a troope of 40. they had order to haſten away after the <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi> This was the <hi>Crabats</hi> worke commonly: who being of the nimbleſt Horſe; were ſtill left laſt in the Quarters, and to bring word of the comming of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>And yet durſt theſe, afterwards at <hi>Prague,</hi> contend for it; That they had as good of the <hi>Day,</hi> as the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> for which their Arguments were, that they kill'd the King; much about as many men; and brought away almoſt 60 Enſignes. Had they onely mentioned the King, their argument had beene better, then their other reaſons can make it. Tis true indeed that when our 2. Countrimen told Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> afterwards, that they boaſted to have taken ſo many <hi>Enſignes:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">They tooke more Colours, then the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh.</hi>
                        </note> nay (ſaies he) thats too lowd: but they have indeed taken 45. and we have 17. or 18. of their Colours. But, now, the loſſe of their Cannon, their leaving the field unto their enemies; and their right downe running away, when none purſued after them: the Court of <hi>

                        </note> And therefore, there was but a faint <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> made for it: a few peeces ſhot off, but not a Bonfire that I heare

                     <p>The <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> having taken Sanctuary in <hi>Leipſich;</hi> there came the next day, ſome 1000. or 1500. Footemen to him: whereof ſome had Colours, and other ſome had loſt them. Theſe were the remainders of 40. Enſignes. A little after,<note place="margin">The way of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſteins</hi> flight.</note> came the Lieftenant-Felt-Marſhall <hi>Holck,</hi> with the Sergeant-Major-Generall, Count <hi>Ridolfo Coloredo,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Grande,</hi> and ſome others of great quality. And now alſo came their Baggage-Wagons: waited upon with a Horſe-Convoye. In the night about 6. a clocke, were all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Born,</hi> 14. miles onwards of the way, towards <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia:</hi> the Generall himſelfe within three houres and a halfe (the ſame night) following them. <hi>Holck</hi> ſtaid ſtill in <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſich:</hi> who going away next day, delivered up the Keyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Magiſtrates againe; with ſuch a like Complement. That he was now as good as his word, as it became every honeſt man to be. He hoped therefore, they would ſpeake nothing but honour of him: and ſhow themſelues merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (as became good <hi>Christians</hi>) unto ſuch ſicke and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as he left in their towne behind him. That day, ſome 16. or 17. troopes of Horſe paſſed by, in ſight of the City, with abundance of the Boores Cattle, going towards their <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Excellency, went not into <hi>Born,</hi> but Quartered that night hard by it.

And now were the ſhattered troopes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into their winter Quarters: <hi>Walenstein</hi> himſelfe with the remnants of the 2.

                        <hi>Battell,</hi> &amp; their diligent attendance upon him in the flight: he ordered to waite upon him in his owne Palace; and by Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to keepe guard about him. They were as his meniall ſervants; they had their allowance for a ſtanding table in his Court; his owne people ſerved them: and he himſelfe ſometimes would ſee they had their allowance. Theſe were relieved, (that is changed) every 8. dayes: and then had every man 6. or 8. <hi>Bohemian</hi> dollars given him (each worth 3s. <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and their Wives or Wenches halfe as much.</p>

And thus much, of the doings of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, both in their flight and in <hi>Bohemia</hi> have I learned from Captaine <hi>Edward Feilding.</hi>

                     <p>THE morning began to peepe, when newes came that the King now altogether in Battell-ray did march up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: whereupon His Excellency preſently caſt his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into that forme, which appeareth in the Figure, leaving a little way on the right hand ſome <hi>Wind-mills,</hi> according to the diſpoſition and neceſſitie of the ſituation. The King had in the meane while, put his Army right oppoſite to ours, not full diſtant the reach of a Cannon: approaching with his <hi>left Wing</hi> neere upon <hi>Lutzen;</hi> and with the <hi>right,</hi> touching upon a little Wood: which alſo was very neere united with his <hi>Front.</hi> In this order did his Excellency ſtay, till the King ſhould begin to moove: wee having a ſmall ditch along the <hi>Front</hi> of our Army. The King mooved ſoone after, with all his forces, making a ſhow that he was reſolv'd to inveſt vs, ſome-while upon one ſide, ſome-while upon the other. At length, hee ſet upon us in the <hi>Front,</hi> and ſent his <hi>Cavallery</hi> of the <hi>right Wing,</hi> to overturne ours. By reaſon hereof, we were forced to retire our Baggage which was upon our <hi>left Wing,</hi> quite behind all our Army, to the end it ſhould not be cut off from us. Thus began the Encounter with equall order, and continuall ſhot of Cannon: which did on each ſide mutuall hurt: every one ſtriving to get forward, thorow the midſt of mortalitie and ſlaughter of men, for to drive the enemy out of his place. The Earle of <hi>Pappenheim</hi> came in at the very beginning of the fight, with ſome Regiments of Horſe and Dragooners: whom hee inſtantly carryed into the <hi>left Wing</hi> where it appear'd the King did charge with moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy. And here the Earle giving the onſett with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd valour, was in the very beginning mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Fauconett: ſo that being taken off his Horſe to be brought to <hi>Leipſich,</hi> He ended his life before his Iourney: This valerous Cavalier having ſacrificed himſelfe to Gods ſervice and the Emperours, in the moſt important occaſion which ever hath offerd it ſelfe to benefit the Catholike <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and the whole <hi>Houſe of Auſtria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the meane time the <hi>Front</hi> of the enemies Army, got

                        </gap> Reſolution: our Artillery being neuer able to diſorder it though many a ſhot was made upon it: and being now comne neere the ditch which was made on our ſide, a great number of Muskettiers was let downe into it, from whence they gave us many good <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ees.</hi> But eſpecially did they powre lead, into the Regiment of the Colonell <hi>Piccolomini:</hi> Who after he had beene expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a-while to the diſcretion of thoſe Muskettiers, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſet upon them, and to drive them out of the Ditch. And this he did accordingly, with ſo fortunate a ſucceſſe, that if he had beene ſeconded by other Regiments, no doubt but that part of the Enemies Army would have beene utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rowted. But there being none to backe him, and he fearing to be cut off from the Army, (if hee went too farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) reſolv'd to ſet with might and maine upon a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="margin">Winckles.</note> of the Enemies, which He alſo utterly defeated, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſtretched out upon the ground, in the ſame manner as it had ſtood before ordred in Squadrons. After <hi>Pappenheim</hi> was wounded, the Cavalry which he had led, never ſo much as turn'd their faces againſt the Enemy: whereby advantage was given him to get the better of our Foot alſo on the <hi>left ſide.</hi> For all this, on the <hi>right ſide</hi> was the fight maintained, with equall and all poſſible obſtinacie: at which time, a newes being ſpread of the Kings death, it ſeemed that the Enemies Army began to give backe by little and little under the favour of a very thicke miſt which was riſen: inſomuch that at firſt, it was not poſſible to finde where it ſtood: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for the preſent, the victory was held to be ours. We being deſirous to goe forward to ſeeke out the Enemy, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was had, that he went to rejoyne his Squadrons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Wood ſide: for which reaſon his Excellence ſent his Colonels <hi>Tercica</hi> and <hi>Picolomini</hi> to take more exact notice of what was rumor'd. They being paſt on a little forward towards the Wood, ſaw the Enemy in full Battell-ray, marching up towards us: in as good an order as at the firſt. It was now very neere night; and our Army not well joyned
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18715:87"/> together: neceſſitie conſtrain'd vs to make a ſtay in our owne place, neere the <hi>Wind-mills,</hi> which the Earle <hi>Coloredo</hi> defended valerouſly. He being charg'd by forces, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably much greater, ſhould have beene forc'd to quit the <hi>Mills,</hi> had not his Excellency ſent to his ſuccour the Colonels <hi>Tercica</hi> and <hi>Picolomini</hi> with their Cavalry, to ſuſtaine the ſhocke of thoſe Foot; as in effect they did. It was now upon ſhutting in of the Euening, when the Enemy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning afreſh a round <hi>Salvee</hi> of his Cannon, did notably annoy our troopes and was like to have done more harme, had not the Night come on. His Excellency, when he leaſt fear'd ſuch an accident,<note place="margin">Then was hee not in his <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as <hi>Le Soldat Suedois</hi> geeres him.</note> (being now in the <hi>Front</hi> of the Regiment of <hi>Picolomini,</hi> ſpeaking with him) was hurt in the left arme with a Muskett Bullet: but (as we may ſay) almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly: ſince it did him no other harme, then to leave a blacke and blew mark behind it. His Excellency ſhowed that day no ordinary valour, riding up and downe in the <hi>Front</hi> of all the Regiments: where from time to time neceſſitie call'd him: encouraging with his preſence, every body to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their duty, being accompanied by the two Princes, brothers of the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> of whom the one call'd <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> loſt his Horſe he ſate on by a Cannon Bullett. The Colonels <hi>Lò</hi> and <hi>Camargo</hi> dyed on the place <hi>Picolomini</hi> came off with ten Muskettado's, five wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wounded him in divers parts of the body; th'other five went no further then his armour. He loſt foure Horſes under him,<note place="margin">In theſe foure numbers, lyes the chiefeſt of my Authors miſ-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie.</note> and three hundred of his beſt ſouldiers: His Sergeant-Major, two Captaines, and moſt of his officers were hurt. It is thought, that of our ſide, there dyed neere upon three thouſand; but a great many more wounded. Of the enemies ſide, were loſt neere ſixe thouſand, and as many more woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: it having beene the moſt bloody and obſtinate Battell, which ever hath beene fought in <hi>Germany;</hi> eſpecially in ſo ſmall a number of the Imperialiſts which came not to twelve thouſand, where on the other ſide, the Enemies Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to above twentie thouſand.</p>

                     <p>At length, the fight being ended by reaſon of the night; his Excellency, was not reſolued whether he ſhould keepe his army in that place, or elſe to retire to <hi>Leipſich.</hi> But having heard the opinion of all his greateſt Officers, he determined, with their good liking, to retire to <hi>Leipſich,</hi> notwithſtanding the arrivall of five Regiments<note n="*" place="margin">This ſets the report right for both ſides.

The noiſe of his death, was preſently ſcattered abroad; yet beliefe was not fully given to it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the relation which ſome priſoners made, as that the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18715:88"/> King was hurt, but carrried off in a cloſe Coach, following his white Standard. But an Aſtrologer entertained by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, being taken priſoner accidentally in the Battell, and ranſomed eight dayes after; brought undoubted newes, that the King was wounded with a Musket in his arme and two Piſtoll bullets, and falne downe dead in the field.</p>
                     <p>The death of the King halfe verified the Prognoſtication of an Aſtrologer named <hi>David Herlicius</hi> of <hi>Stargard</hi> in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania;</hi> who ſaid ſome moneths before, that the King ſhould never paſſe over the Kiver of <hi>Elve</hi> againe: which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting to his benefit; beleeved he ſhould become Maſter of the Empire, (as among his <hi>Collegiates</hi> he was already repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">You have no word here, of the Imperialiſts arrogating of the Victory to their partie.</note>) and ceaſe to returne into <hi>Swedland,</hi> where is nothing elſe but craggy mountaines. But God who diſpoſeth all things, hath made vaine the iſſue of that hope, and given us to underſtand, that to him alone is reſerved the diſpoſing of Empires.</p>

                     <p>And they now hearing of the <hi>Battell,</hi> and of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts forſaking of <hi>Leipſich:</hi> begin to ſtirre for the recovery of it.

Theſe taking the abſolute poſſeſſion and Maſtery of the Towne, give preſent ſummons to the Caſtle of <hi>Pleiſſenburg;</hi> where there yet was an Imperiall garriſon.

Muskettiers came in place of them. Some alſo, were ſent from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armie: that all might ioyne together in the cleering of the countrie. All this day the ordnance thundred ſo vpon the caſtle, that a peece of the Bulwarke was beaten flatt downe with it. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

                     <p>I paſſe by ſmaller rencounters; becauſe I haſten (like the <hi>Swediſh</hi>) to cleere the greater townes, of the Imperialiſts. And they, it appeares, made ſuch haſt to do it, that they gave farre better conditions to the next towne, (for a packing penny) then they had done to both the former.

And now are the <hi>Saxon</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, returned againe towards <hi>Sileſia:</hi> for that thereabouts, the Imperialiſts began a-new to buſtle.</p>
                     <p>The Baron <hi>de Suvis,</hi> was now Governour of <hi>Zuicka:</hi> and he preparing for defence, burnes downe the Suburbs; forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and mans the great Church, the Towne-houſe, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.

Then were theſe <hi>Articles</hi> concluded upon.</p>

That is to ſay, with Horſes, Saddles, Piſtols, Carabines, and Cornets: and with their Baggage in like manner, as was granted to the Foote-forces.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Imperiall Commiſſary <hi>Conradus à Schleisburg;</hi> ſhall alſo be comprehended in the Treaty.</p>

After which, they ſhall be ſuffered to depart, without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this end, ſhall order be given to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> ſouldiers; that the Baron <hi>De Suvie</hi> and his ſouldiers (Horſe and Foote) be ſuffered to depart, without wrong or moleſtation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> aſſure alſo, that they ſhall not goe about, either by money or other wayes; to debauch or inveigle away any of the Imperiall ſouldiers, into their ſervice.</p>

Next yeere, which was Anno 1611. King <hi>Charles</hi> his Father dyed: when himſelfe, then but a <hi>Minor</hi> of 17. yeeres of age, was called to the Kingdome. The entry into his reigne, was the tryall of his education: his Father left him embroyled with the <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Muskovite;</hi> and ſhortly after, began the <hi>Polander</hi> to confront him. The pretences of theſe Princes, were indeed much different: but in the ruine of a young King, they all had the ſame intentions. <hi>Poland</hi> clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Crowne; Denmarke</hi> and the <hi>Muskovite;</hi> put in to recover what bordering lands they had before claimed; and which, had either beene conquered from them, by his Anceſtors, or freely for merite granted them, by the others.

                     <p>Two of his young ſchollers prizes, twere pitty to paſſe over.

                     <p>Some while after this, had he a difference with the <hi>Dantzickers:</hi> who man'd out 20. or 30. good Ships of Warre; with the firſt opening of the Spring,

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18715:99"/> would the <hi>Legend</hi> be more <hi>Apocryphall.</hi> For what credulity, (not facile to be abuſed) could perſwade it ſelfe, that 2. third parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> could (and by him that entred but with 11000. men) in 2. yeeres and 4. moneths ſpace, be wreſted from ſo puiſſant an Emperour? A mighty Empire and a Potent; formidable for its greatneſſe, confident upon the power of its Colleagues and Vpholders: vaſt in its extent, terrible for its Armes and Captaines; renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for its Conqueſts, beyond expectation, ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all its enterpriſes: and that knew no bounds, but the <hi>Alpes</hi> and the <hi>Ocean.</hi> And yet this Empire, which either with its Armies, or garriſons: if not by a cheaper way, the meere reputation of what it had, or might doe; held ſo many Princes at a <hi>Baye:</hi> was it ſelfe conſtrained to take on the yoake, which <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Gantlett put upon it. In leſſe then 2. yeers and a halfe, he did all this: what might He more haue atchieved, had he gone on another yeere and two moneths: and fil'd up the time of that malicious and falſe prediction, which the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> had caſt abroad of him? They comforted their credulous <hi>Novices,</hi> with his being <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and that he ſhould raigne 3. yeeres and a halfe, and no longer.</p>
                     <p>The beleefe of his conquering ſo much, will be the more facilitated: if we could but conceive (once) his familiar way of doing it: he made but a <hi>Comedy</hi> of the warres: which others are ſo ſolemne upon; and make ſo full of Tragedy. I will giue but two examples. Comming before <hi>Elbing</hi> with an Army, ſcarce ſo ſtrong as their garriſon; he after Summons
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18715:99"/> and Hoſtages; wormes out by faire words, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſter and ſome great ones, to his Tent unto a Parlee. Himſelfe, in the meane time, with ſome few of his Gentlemen, goes to the Ports and deſires to come in as a travayler, to pleaſe his ſight with the rarities of their City. Such pleaſancy of words and conceit he uſed, that the Citizens were as deſirous to ſee the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as he to take their City. Being in, he walkes gazing up and downe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flocking ſtill after him. Now in truth good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſaies he) if I had thought you had deſired to ſee the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> I would have put on my beſt cloathes to day. What need you feare me? my <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Fins</hi> ſhall be your drudges, cleave wood, fetch water, and doe you any ſervility: and with that he calls a ſtubbed <hi>Finn</hi> to him, and commands him to remoove ſome lumber, or piece of rubbiſh. This ſaid, he goes into a Stationers ſhop, and there calls for <hi>Buchanans Poemes:</hi> iuſt as in ſuch a caſe <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſometimes did, for <hi>Homers Iliades.</hi> And thus the Burgomaſter knowing, that the King was in the towne; and He being ſure, that the Burgomaſter was in His Tent: the compoſition became the eaſier. At that very ſtrong towne of <hi>Konigſhoven</hi> in <hi>Franconia,</hi> after this; ſhowed he another example of this face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious facility. Having ſummoned the towne, hee rides up along towards the Ports: where when hee ſaw the guards blowing their matches, and making ready to ſhoote him: <hi>Sacrament</hi> (ſaies he) if you make but one ſhot, the King ſhall know of it; and he hath vowed that not a man of you ſhall have Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18715:100"/> But if you will treate fairely, you ſhall have your owne conditions. This was his order (moſtly) in taking of a towne: he would not ſtand entrenching and building <hi>Redoubts,</hi> at a miles diſtance: but clap downe with his Army preſently, about Cannon ſhot from it. There would he begin his Approaches, get to their walls, Batter and Storme, preſently: and if he ſaw the place were not by a running pull to be taken: he would not loſe above 4. or 6. dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; but riſe and to another. And thus did hee at <hi>Ingolſtat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tis a hard taske to give you the iuſt portraiture of this Prince: he was ſo perpetually in action, that he ſeldome gave himſelfe time to ſit, to have it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But theſe (in generall) are the rough drawings of his perſonall excellencies. He bare a Port and Preſence, full of a gracious Majeſtie; full fleſht, and fac't: a rich and a gallant ſtature, 2. yeards and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: a hawkes eye; the world thought an Eagles. His more then flaxen-coloured haire, inclined to the colour of <hi>Apolloes:</hi> a ſigne hee had much of the <hi>Sunne</hi> in him. His tone of ſpeech, was of a manly and a maſterly pronunciation: and his anſwers were quicke, full, ſmart, but not gybing: cleane limb'd he was, ſtrong, active, and hardy: made up as fitly for a King, as for a Generall. But for the gueſt that raigne in this Palace, &amp; actuated it; his <hi>mind,</hi> and his <hi>ſpirit:</hi> thats to be beſt gueſſed at by his Conqueſts. An vndaunted courage, a ſtrong iudgement, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable quickneſſe of conceit, a naturall vigilancy and indefatigableneſſe, a marvailous forecaſt, with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18715:100"/> the beſt advantage to apprehend and diſpoſe of his occaſions: theſe were his <hi>perſonall forces,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſo much of <hi>Germany.</hi> Looke elſe into his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer. See there his encamping, his fortifying, his new wayes of fighting, and embatteling; his orders, his proviſions, his directions, and the ſoule and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of all theſe, his owne diligences: and then tell me, how he were eaſie to be reſiſted. An excellent dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity beſides, was he endowed withall, to extricate and untangle the <hi>Gordian</hi> knottineſſe of a buſineſſe; the maſter-ſpirit he had, over all that came before him; a gift, withall to take the advantage of mens humours; and a native attraction in him, to winne hearts, as well as Provinces. A great Student hee was, upon any buſineſſe of importance: and when his <hi>Chancellor</hi> was with him, a diligent diſputer and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſer of the Anſwer, which he was to give to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</p>
                     <p>He would have the proiecting of the deſigne, ſtill to paſſe from his owne invention; ſeldome calling a formall <hi>Councell of Warre;</hi> and yet not deſpiſing to aske upon the <hi>Bye,</hi> the adviſes of his Commanders. He contented not himſelfe to be the Generall of an Army, but he would be a Captain, yea a Sergeant of a band; an Enginier, a common ſouldier, a Canonier: all, or any thing. The ſurpriſe and ſuddenneſſe of a danger, ſeldome aſtonied his iudgement: but the more deſperate the peril were, the nimbler, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was he in his deliveries; ſtill ſhewing moſt vigor, where there was moſt need of it. There was not an enterpriſe to be gone upon, not beneath the honour
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18715:101"/> of a Colonell; but let the danger be what it would, he would leade on the Partee. And twas an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to behold, that he was not onely not worne out with the affiduity of his labours and his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; but that he battned and grew fat upon action: comming freſh off from one, and ſtill preſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for another enterprize. Hee grew fat, I ſay, not with eating and drinking; no Prince was more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate then he, thoſe wayes. His feeding was upon ſtrong and ſouldierly diſhes: not ſuch delicacies, as were dainty of taſte, and eaſie of digeſtion; but ſuch luſty, bearing meates, as would encreaſe ſtrength, and make reſiſtance in the ſtomacke. Drinking, he was not taxt for: and notwithſtanding it be the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne way of ſinning; yet came not he to out-drinke the <hi>Germanes:</hi> they were not that way to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Briefly, that Northerne corner of the world, hath not brought forth a Prince of his <hi>temper,</hi> and <hi>temperance;</hi> or a man ſo generally well put together, in all imaginable abilities and perfections; to make a Generall of. And ſo much, have the contriving and conduct of his deſignes, manifeſted; which hee had even almoſt given their period unto.</p>
                     <p>I have left out the beſt part yet; and that was his <hi>Religion:</hi> his devotion in his <hi>Religion,</hi> (publike and private) and his frequent <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> (eſpecially upon all eminenter occaſions) were the things that rendred him admirable. He would pray a ſhip-board, and a ſhoare; in the Field, and in the midſt of a Battell: as if <hi>Prayer</hi> alone, were the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt piece of all his whole Armour. And in his open
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18715:101"/> 
                        <hi>Prayers,</hi> this one thing is of all the reſt, moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; That as other times he had ſworne, publikely ſworne; that his purpoſes were not to <hi>Conquer,</hi> but to <hi>Deliver:</hi> ſo in his Prayers for divine aſſiſtance, would he boldly appeale to God the ſearcher of the hearts, that Hee knew his intentions to be no other. That a Prince, now, ſhould thus dare it in the face of Heaven; and call downe iuſt vengeance from thence, if hee meant not Gods glory in ſincerity: they muſt bee his enemies, that will not beleeue it.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt imperfection of his body, was that his eyes, were dimme ſighted: that though he could forſee, no eye better, yet could he not diſcerne farre from him. The greateſt infirmity of his mind, was his <hi>Cholerickneſſe:</hi> a paſſion, indeed which he could not ſo well controll; and which would eaſily, now and then, burſt forth, upon a ſlight, or imaginaned provocation. But this was an inbred humour, not a humorouſneſſe in him: and the uſuall uncorrected vigourouſneſſe of thoſe Spirits it is, that have a rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er allowance of Spirit and Fire in them. This though it muſt be confeſſed, to be a peccancy, and a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; yet is it to be obſerved withall, that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancies of the 4. Humours, this principally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man fit for action. And truely, it might in him the better be excuſed, for that he was ſtill enchaft with buſineſſes; and had ſo many diſpoſitions of men, and ſucceſſes of affaires, to encounter withall: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſometimes, when he found but awckward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This fault indeed, was he noted for: and tis for him that writes his <hi>Apologie,</hi> not his <hi>Character;</hi> to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18715:102"/> denie or defend it. And yet this helpe there was for it: that vpon a very litle conſideration, he would take himſelfe with the maner, and take vp, preſently: and with a gratious debonnaireneſſe and ſweetneſſe, which was naturall to him, giue checke to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſhing of ſome leſſe aduiſed and indigeſted ſpeeches, that had in choler ſlipt from him. Ready, beſides, of himſelfe, he was, to giue ſatisfaction: not vnto the <hi>Grandees</hi> and <hi>Chiefes</hi> onely of his Armies, whoſe merits and ſeruices might take the more exceptions to ſuch vſage: but euen to the common ſouldiers alſo, who ought not to ſtand vpon ſuch <hi>puntilioes</hi> with a King their Generall. This would he doe eaſily; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where he found himſelfe vſed like a King, and ſued vnto.</p>
                     <p>Himſelfe would ſay, when he tooke notice now and then, of this touchineſſe of his owne nature, ſo apt with a little ſpark to take fire: <hi>That he muſt endure, ever and anon, the diverſities of their humours; the flegme of ſome, and the drinke of others: and that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, therefore, they ought ſomething the better to beare with his cholerickneſſe.</hi> And an indifferent temper in men, would have paſſed by this infirmity in him; could they have but conſideted the multitudes and varieties of thoſe greater thoughts, which were ſtill agitated in that ever working braine and ſpirit of his; wound up, and labouring upon the ſtretch, without intermiſſion. A man, me thinks, ſhould doe with a bad humor in a Prince, as with a bad Angell: give him his full Graines, and Allowances; and then weigh him. But if you pleaſe to put into the either skale,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18715:102"/> thoſe extraordinary many vertues in him: his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diſpoſition, his eaſineſſe of acceſſe, the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarneſſe of his carriage, his care that every common ſouldier ſhould have his due, and his moderation in the greatneſſe of his ſucceſſes, not thinking his ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow one ſpanne the more ſpreading; then ſurely, the beame would ſo caſt it on the better ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide, that his choler would ſeeme but as the duſt of the balance, to them.</p>
                     <p>But yet another fault was there in this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince, which (now) hath ſpoyl'd all the reſt. That, namely, his courage ſuffered his Iudgement no better to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the duties of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Carabin,</hi> and a <hi>Generall</hi> of an Army; but would adventure the King, as farre as the <hi>Leader</hi> of a <hi>Partee:</hi> and that, by conſequence, he tooke no better care for the ſaving and ſparing of the beſt blood of the Army; but was too too prodigall an unthrift of it. The marvaile is not, that he was ſo hazardous of it, in a Cauſe ſo glorious; but that in all thoſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he loſt no more of it: his owne life, perpetually, being as farre and forwardly engaged, and ſtill run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame hazards; with the meaneſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But yet for taking off this blame from him; this, in his diſcharge, is to be ſaid: That that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſtitution of his, not of fire onely, but of flame, made all the valour and couragiouſneſſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, behold unto his example; and that the well ſpeeding of his ſo many victories, was principally to be aſcribed to his preſence in the encounters: the very ſight of ſuch a Leader, like ſome puiſſant <hi>Aſpect</hi>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18715:103"/> in the heavenly <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> infuſing a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and irrradiation of courage into his owne; and of fright and terrour, into his enemies.</p>
                     <p>And by theſe excellencies, arrived he to this height of glory: even of a military glory. And ſee what a true-raiſ'd Fame can doe! it hath ſomething in it, not onely beyond the nature of an <hi>Eagle,</hi> but of a <hi>Starre,</hi> too; for the higher aire this Prince wrought himſelfe up into, the fuller, ſtill, and the liker <hi>Statua,</hi> his vertues have appeared; and he big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the eye of envie, in his <hi>Mountie.</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies meerly up of <hi>craft</hi> or <hi>fortune,</hi> doe out of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningneſſe affect to conceale their owne greatneſſes. Like <hi>Mercury</hi> among the <hi>Plantets:</hi> who though of a fiery and a fluſhing luſter: yet ſo politicke a Courtier and cloſe a waiter he is, (and that upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry:) as by ever crowding neer the Sunne, he hath gained to walke ſo farre obſcured under his Maſters glories; that his devouteſt ſervants (the <hi>Aſtronomers</hi>) can ſeldome or never procure the ſight of him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Bodyes</hi> made up of true <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>ſubstance;</hi> are like the <hi>Sunne</hi> it ſelfe, then arrived to the brighteſt of their Beauties, when in the higheſt degree of their <hi>Exaltations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is ſomething, towards the <hi>Character</hi> of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> whileſt he was. And alas that I muſt ſay, <hi>Whileſt he was!</hi> Now would I give all my part in <hi>Grammer,</hi> to alter but one <hi>Tenſe,</hi> and to ſay <hi>He is.</hi> But becauſe <hi>He is</hi> no more amongſt us, this <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Story</hi> of his, may ſerve in ſtead of his <hi>Picture;</hi> to conſerve his memory. I confeſſe I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18715:103"/> am not <hi>Limner</hi> cunning enough, to give every part of him, his true <hi>ſtelling</hi> and proportion: nor have I the Art, either with <hi>ſweete</hi> touches or <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly</hi> ſtroaks, ſo to <hi>heigthen</hi> up my Peece, or make it to <hi>ſtand off,</hi> as every way to be like him. In this onely doe I pleaſe my ſelfe, that thoſe who have had the honour to be about his perſon; may here refigure a touch or two, that come ſomething neere the <hi>Life</hi> of him. This alſo I aſſure my ſelfe of, that thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler foes, who have ſometimes beene made feele his Armes: will be amongſt the liberalleſt to contribute towards his praiſes; if it be but onely to take off ſomething from their owne loſſes, to juſtifie their owne diſgraces; and to ſhow that no man inferiour to this <hi>Character,</hi> could have beene thus active and ſucceſſefull upon them.</p>
                     <p>That which is admirable beyond all the reſt, is, That this Prince hath left the affaires behind him, in an eſtate ſeeming advantageous to both parties. The one ſide, thinke skales turn'd, by his killing. His owne Allyes, he left in poſſeſſion of more then two third parts of <hi>Germany:</hi> of the better townes, and the greater rivers; even from the <hi>Vistula</hi> in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovia,</hi> unto the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danuby:</hi> the <hi>Oder,</hi> the <hi>Elb,</hi> the <hi>Danuby,</hi> the <hi>Mayn</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> all theſe are witneſſes of his perſonall <hi>Trophees:</hi> and ſo are the <hi>Weſer</hi> and the <hi>Moſel,</hi> of others of his Captaines. To continue theſe Conqueſts, he left ſeven faire Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies behind him, with their Generals. In the <hi>Vpper Saxony,</hi> his owne, to Duke <hi>Bernard;</hi> in the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. under Baron <hi>Kniphauſen:</hi> In <hi>Sileſia</hi> a third,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18715:104"/> under <hi>Dubalt.</hi> In <hi>Bavaria</hi> a fourth, under the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Birckenfelt.</hi> About <hi>Cullen</hi> a fifth, under <hi>Baudiſsin:</hi> in <hi>Alſatia</hi> a ſixth, under <hi>Guſtavus Horn:</hi> and in <hi>Schwabland</hi> a ſeuenth, under The Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthven.</hi> I reckon not the <hi>Saxons:</hi> the <hi>Lunenburgers,</hi> the <hi>Bremers,</hi> nor the <hi>Heſſens;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under their owne Princes: though all, whileſt he lived, by him, as the <hi>Generall Director of the Wars,</hi> to be commanded. Adde to this, the ſtrength of his Confederacies: all Princes, (excepting thoſe of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> ſome few <hi>Italians,</hi> and the <hi>Catholike Leaguers</hi>) being his Allyes.</p>
                     <p>What now remaineth, but that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Empire, doe goe on ſtill, to purſue the advantages, which he left unto them; to baniſh all perſonall jealouſies, and mis-intelligences; to ſoder up all old ruptures and diviſions; to lay aſide the ſtanding upon their <hi>punto's,</hi> and the Heraldry of their <hi>genealogies;</hi> and to ſuffer the Warres to be conducted, not by Princes of the beſt Houſes, but the greateſt abilities; to husband their time and oportunities; to preſſe action, and not to bee too tedious in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations; to take advantage of what is both paſſed and preſent; to ſtudy how to conſerve their owne eſtates, under that of the Empire; to communicate their counſels, and unite their Forces, for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Freedome</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> This if they be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in; then, all the travels of the deceaſed King; together with all their owne paines and charges: yea all their Forces, Armies, and advantages; ſhall not long ſerve their turnes, but they muſt become the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18715:104"/> prey of their Enemies, an <hi>Amphitheater</hi> of Tragedies, and an example to poſteritie of confiſcated eſtates, and of bodies incurably diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>And to ſay the troth, theſe Princes have even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this preſent, gone ſo well on, that their vnitie hath quite daſht all the exultations of the contrary party; and they have trumped upon the beſt of the others hopes; and happily gone beyond the feares of their friends, that ſtill doubted them. They have given the world to ſee, that the Schooling and leſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the King, hath made good impreſſion in them: and that the loſſe of ſo great a Patrone, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pull'd downe the ſide; yet hath it cauſed their motions to be <hi>concentricall,</hi> to goe all one way; and by union, to redouble their vigours.</p>
                     <p>And yet all this notwithſtanding, and that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath left theſe Princes of his partie, in ſo good eſtate, that they have the leſſe cauſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of him: they being well ſet up on their feet againe, and in caſe to maintaine their owne freedomes. Admit the truth of all this: yet hath the adverſe party, which he gave checke unto, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the better of the game, ſince this <hi>King</hi> is <hi>taken.</hi> Great are their advantages, by the death of this Prince: theſe few pellets of lead which kill'd him, being worth more to them, then a million of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats poſſibly could have advantaged them. And this loſſe of him, who was the <hi>Sole Director</hi> of all; gave not onely hopes, but probabilities; that now, when the buſineſſe was to fall to be managed by a many; the diverſities of <hi>Cheefes,</hi> would bee ſo apt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18715:105"/> to foment iealouſies and miſ-intelligences: as that it would give more facility to the contrary party, to conſerve what was not yet conquered; to ſatisfie ſome privately diſcontented; to vnite their counſels: to recall exiled tranquility; and firmely, once againe, to re-eſtabliſh a good peace over all the Empire.</p>
                     <p>If now, the Imperiall party pleaſe to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by their former loſſes: then ſhall wee ſee them turne a deafe eare to all bloody and violent counſels; avoide the enforcing both of Princes and people, to turne deſperate: remove all ſuſpitions and bad cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies; regaine exaſperated ſpirits, by ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and ſeeke how to raigne by love, rather then by terrour: no more attempting the breach of the peace and publike faith, vnder pretence of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: it being to be dealt withall by perſwaſion, and not by enforcing; as having to anſwer before another Tribunall, then mans Iudgement. And hereunto, it appeareth, that this party ought ſo much the rather to aſpire; becauſe it may have hope even forthwith and henceforward, to continue in their owne rights and advantages: the death of this King, having cured them of a bodily feare they were deeply already in; leaſt he ſhould have taken a higher flight, pretented towards new <hi>Diademes:</hi> and fully have verified his <hi>Anagramme,</hi> by changing the name <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> into <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What-ever in this dull <hi>Character</hi> of mine, may ſeeme defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; is abundantly ſupplyed in this moſt learned and conciſe <hi>Epitaph.</hi> Written by an <hi>Honourable Sonne of the Muſes;</hi> and worthy the <hi>Tombe-Stone</hi> of the great <hi>Guſtavus.</hi>

That whereas it hath pleaſed Almighty God of his providence and good pleaſure, ſo heavily to viſit us and this Kingdome, and in ſo great a meaſure to afflict us, by taking unto himſelf, (by bodily death) the renowned high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince and Lord, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of the <hi>Swedens
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18715:107"/> Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales, Great Prince of Finland. Duke of Eſtland and Carellen.</hi> Lord of <hi>Ingormanland,</hi> &amp;c. and to tranſlate his bleſſed Maieſty (of ever happy and famous memory) out of this vale of miſery, into his eternall happineſſe and heauenly ioy: and to exchange his temporall Crowne into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Diademe of glory: and ſo to have put a period, not onely to his Maieſties carefull and labourious life and dayes, but alſo to his ſufficiently noted and renowned Counſells, worthy actes, couragious and vndaunted ſpirit; almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, at leaſtwiſe wonderfull Victories, againſt part of the mightieſt and moſt powerfull Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi> And which wee chiefely muſt condole: in him it hath pleaſed God to take from vs our head, our King, our father and <hi>Pater patriae:</hi> Vnder whoſe worthy, famous, and moſt excellent raigne, we aboue all other Nations, in theſe dolefull and calamitous times; haue found our ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition, in all ſecurity, ſafety and tranquillity. And which aggrauates our miſery, it hath not pleaſed God to ſuffer any <hi>Heyer-Male</hi> to proceed from the loynes of his ſaid bleſſed Majeſty, to remaine upon, and to poſſeſſe his Fathers ſeate. So that, not without reaſon, ours and the Kingdomes care and danger is the greater; and wee cannot but ſo much the more take to heart this ineſtimable loſſe. Wherefore, vpon the Iniunction of the Peeres and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Realme, at their conuenting: we haue thought good, vnanimouſly and obediently to come together, in the feare of God; and to take into conſideration the preſent State of our Kings Majeſties: Heyer, as alſo the State of our deare Kingdome. And how the ſame may be happily up held and maintained: and (next under the ayde and helpe of <hi>God</hi>) bee defended againſt all danger and oppoſition. To this end, we are all of us ioyntly and willingly aſſembled here, and wee haue pondered and conſulted together, which might beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the good of the Realme. And at laſt, by the helpe of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and in the name of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity;</hi> we haue cloſely vnited, and ſtrongly bound and tyed our ſelues;

                        <p>Inprimis. Whereas the death of our bleſſed and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King, hath cauſed a Kingly raigne to ceaſe among us: and the Cauſe ſo being, that their is no <hi>Heyer-Male</hi> left behind his Maieſty: nor any Children of any Hereditary Prince; which might by undoubted right, ſucceed according to the Lawes and conſtitutions of the Realme. We have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approoved of that, which was concluded at <hi>Workoping,</hi> Anno 1604. concerning the <hi>Renewing of the Hereditary coniunction:</hi> and concerning the <hi>Daughters of our Kings and Heyer-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> which in that aſſembly was confirmed and enacted. As alſo that, which unanimouſly and ioyntly was concluded by us here preſent, at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> anno 1627. on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, as followeth. That in caſe his bleſſed and famous Maieſty ſhould happen to deceaſe: We did conclude, that his daughter the Princeſſe, <hi>the High borne, Chriſtina,</hi> ſhould be choſen for our <hi>Queene</hi> and <hi>Inheritrix</hi> of our Kingdome. And therefore at this time doe we againe eſtabliſh unanimouſly, (and that in conſideration of the famous and magnanimous acts and deeds, of the two worthy Kings; King <hi>Guſtavus the firſt,</hi> and eſpecially of King <hi>Guſtavus the laſt,</hi> lately deceaſed: (whom iuſtly we may terme <hi>Guſtavus the Great</hi>) by which two, and more eſpecially by the <hi>latter,</hi> we have received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable benefit and fame; and conſequently, are bound to render all honour and reſpect, to this well-borne Princeſſe) according to our former promiſe and obligation: and doe now renew, what we heretofore have maturely confirmed. That is to ſay; Wee doe declare, pronounce, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; adviſedly, unanimouſly, freely, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; The <hi>high and mightie Princeſſe Chriſtina, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his renowned Maieſtie Guſtavus Adolphus the Second and Great King; Queene of the Swedes, Gothes and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>andales;</hi> lawfully choſen: as alſo <hi>Haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

And if it ſhould ſo fall out (which God forbid,) that any <hi>Swedes,</hi> or who-ever they may be; under the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in high place and dignity: ſhould unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly goe about (either ſecretly or openly) to ſtand up in the behalfe of any of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> or his <hi>Deſcendants,</hi> to be received into the Kingdome of <hi>Sweden:</hi> or to yeeld them any footing within the <hi>Iuriſdictions,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Frontiers of the ſame Kingdome: Wee doe hold the ſame perſon (how ſoever he be) for a pernicious and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Traitour, both to us and the whole State. And if any ſuch, ſhall dare to ſtand out and perſevere in ſo vile an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; he ſhall be ſure to meete with the mercileſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, due to ſuch a Traitour. And moreover, whoſoever he be, that ſhall give eare, and leave to any ſuch; and not in time make it manifeſt and knowne, with his intent that way; ſhall be ſubiect and lyable to the ſame puniſhed. In like ſort ſhall all thoſe be puniſhment, that ſhall dare to harbour or lodge any ſuch perſons, without giving notice and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18715:109"/> to authority. Now whereas at <hi>Orebroo</hi> in the yeere 1617. the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of February: an expreſſe and abſolute <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decree</hi> was eſtabliſhed, againſt all ſuch, by the Peeres and whole State of the Realme: we will and ordaine by theſe preſents, that the ſame <hi>decree</hi> henceforward remaine as invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, as if the ſame were herein expreſſed word by word. Wherefore, It is now by us <hi>concluded</hi> and <hi>decreed,</hi> that the ſame <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>Orebroo,</hi> ſhall be fully executed; and that to the ſame end, all Lords, and Iudges, Officers, &amp;c. each accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his place and office; ſhall be bound to have an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care for the execution and performance of the ſame; as he will otherwiſe anſwer it, at his perill.</p>

                        <p>Fifthly: Whereas our Queene as yet is not come to her compleate yeeres, and full age; ſo that ſhe can be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of her owne ſelfe and ability, to defend and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Kingdome and the Realme: we could wiſh (and happy were we, if it had beene ſo) that there had beene a full <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>order</hi> made by his Maieſty of bleſſed Memory, and the Princes and States of the Realme; ſo that in the ſame there had beene comprehended, whatſoever in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we ought to have cleaved unto. But ſince it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and muſt needs be ſo; and that wee doe underſtand,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18715:109"/> that his renowned Maieſty of bleſſed memory, did commit his intent and reſolution concerning this matter, to the Councell and Lords of this State; and had often comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and deſired them, to conceive a right order concerning the ſame: which they having performed, and therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their opinion, and ſhewed the ſame to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, with his full approbation: yet notwithſtanding, by reaſon of his ſudden death, and other occaſions thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enſuing, hath it not had its full effect: although wee may well wiſh it had. Therefore in this caſe, we have read and manifeſted the ſaid <hi>order</hi> (made by his Maieſty in his time) to ſome of the cheefe amongſt us, and of our State: who, as they haue found the ſame moſt ſound and wholſome; ſo could we wiſh that the ſame were publiſhed to the common view and eyes of all men: and might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ratified unanimouſly by us all, and ſo be publiſhed. But whereas we doe alſo perceive and underſtand, that divers inſtructions and neceſſary appurtenances belonging thereunto, by reaſon of the ſhortneſſe of time, could not conveniently be in readineſſe: we, notwithſtanding, being deſirous to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the welfare and State of the Realme, in all good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding; and likewiſe, that his Maieſty: our moſt gracious and renowned King (of bleſſed memory) his will and care (for which we are for ever bound to extoll his Maieſties name and memory) may really be performed and executed: we do eſpecially; all of us, in the name of the whole State and Realme; <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>ordaine</hi> that the ſame <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>ordinance</hi> of his Majeſty: ſhal be put in execution and performed, in the beſt maner and forme that may be poſſibly, for the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Realme and Countries; by the 5. chiefe States and Officers of the Realme: to wit. 1. The <hi>Lord high Steward,</hi> 2. <hi>Marſhall.</hi> 3. <hi>Admirall.</hi> 4. <hi>Chancellor.</hi> 5. <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> And in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the one or other, or of any: the <hi>Eldeſt of the Councell of State</hi> ſhall ſupply the place. And theſe 5. ſhall be in lieu and place of Government of her Maj: for the Kingdome of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> untill her Maj: be grown (by Gods grace) to perfect yeers.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18715:110"/> And this buſineſſe have we ſufficiently pondered. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſaid five States and Lords, have ever beene of Councell with his Maieſtie of bleſſed memory: and have undergone and waded thorow, the moſt weightieſt affaires of the whole Kingdome: wee have thought good unanimouſly with one generall conſent, to <hi>ordaine</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> as well for our <hi>Aſſociates</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> as for our ſelues; that from henceforward, the five aforeſaid <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Chiefe Officers of the State and Realme,</hi> and in either the one or the other his abſence, the <hi>Eldeſt of our Councell of Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> being of the <hi>ſame Colledge</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſupplying the place, for the welfare and managing of the State of our Kingdome, and the <hi>Tuition of our Queene;</hi> ſhall governe and beare rule, during the <hi>Minority</hi> and <hi>Nonage</hi> of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty: onely in her name and ſtead: and without any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the <hi>Realme</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> or violation or breach of the <hi>Lawes, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the ſame; but rather power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for her Maieſty maintaining the <hi>five brotherly Offices</hi> and <hi>State-Rankes.</hi> To wit. <hi>Courtright Councell: Councell of War, Admiralty, Chauncery,</hi> and <hi>Treaſury</hi> or <hi>Exchequer:</hi> as the ſame have beene by former Kings inſtituted eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and upheld, eſpecially by our laſt King of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Alſo, all dexterity ſhall be vſed and employed by them, for the maintaining and upholding of the <hi>Swediſh Rights, Lawes, Iuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Policy;</hi> as farre as their vttermoſt induſtry and power ſhall be able to extend: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, protecting, all manner of waies, the Realme and Kingdome, and whatſoever depends upon it: In ſuch wiſe, as they in their Conſcience ſhall be willing to anſwer before <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Queene,</hi> and the <hi>State;</hi> when they ſhall be thereunto called; And as theſe doe at this preſent oblige themſelues to thoſe that are, and hereafter ſhall be called, into Authority: and as they doe now oblige themſelues by oath. On the other ſide, We the Peeres and Lords of the Realme, doe promiſe to yeeld unto theſe <hi>five ſelected Chiefe Offices:</hi> and to the <hi>Eldeſt of the Councell</hi> that ſhall ſupply ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18715:110"/> of their roomes; not onely all worthy reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but alſo all obedience and ſubmiſſiue ſubiection: in whatſoever they ſhall require and command us, tending to the glory of Almighty God, the good and welfare of the Queene, and of the State and Common-wealth. And in caſe any one ſhould goe about to oppoſe and to croſſe this manner of proceeding, or government; either in deed or word: We ſhall by all our powers labour to ſuppreſſe ſuch inſolencies, and to puniſh ſuch parties; and ſo conſtraine them to true obedience.</p>

Whereas alſo it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that wee Arme, ſtrengthen and provide our ſelues, againſt other accrewing and newly growing enemies; and to have a ſpeciall care, to prevent all dangers and oppoſitions which may enſue: we have therefore <hi>ordered</hi> and <hi>ordained;</hi> and doe now <hi>will</hi> and <hi>ordaine,</hi> That the ſame <hi>Edict</hi> and <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which the laſt Harveſt time was concluded and confirmed: ſhall with all ſpeed and expedition be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed through out the whole Realme and Kingdome: direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the ſame forme, as we firſt ordered: with condition, that all mens rights and priviledges ſhall thereby be kept inviolable. And by theſe preſents we doe promiſe, and doe freely conſent and grant; with and upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, that in caſe the neede and neceſſity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall ſo require; whether it be by reaſon of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that we are already fallen into; or in reſpect of ſome

                        <p>Seventhly, We know well enough, that no Kingdome can poſſibly ſubſiſt without means: neither can any Warre be rightly managed, without great charges.

And yet ſome briefe recapitulation, doe I thinke convenient to make of them.</p>
                     <p>Moſt apparent it is, that his ſaid ſacred Maieſty (now at reſt in the Lord) was without any formall denuntiation of warre, infeſted by the Emperor. His Ambaſſadors, comming with the offer and meanes of a peaceable compounding of depending Controverſies; moſt diſgracefull entreated: yea, and (contrary to all lawes of nations and civility) not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcornefull affronts offered, turned home againe; and the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18715:113"/> whole Treaty by that vſage, abruptly broken off with him. That his ſubiects of <hi>Sweden,</hi> even contrary to long uſage, amity, and Covenants, heretofore, in generall, contracted with the <hi>Romane Empire;</hi> and in particular, with certaine neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes and <hi>Free-States,</hi> have beene diſturbed in their Commerces, <hi>Embargo's</hi> laid upon their Ships, and fetters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſaylers.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Catholike Leaguers,</hi> likewiſe, notwithſtanding that among other <hi>Electors</hi> of the Empire they had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, that they would be pleaſed to forbeare the making themſelues parties in theſe differences, but rather to ſeeke how to find redreſſe for them: and notwithſtanding, that at the requeſt of the <hi>French</hi> King, confederated with his ſacred Maieſty; there had beene <hi>Neutrality</hi> granted unto the ſaid <hi>Leaguers,</hi> if ſo be they thought good to accept of it: yet did they not onely refuſe that <hi>Neutrality,</hi> but entred alſo into a ſtricter confederation of warres againſt his ſaid Maieſty; and conioyning their forces under their Generall <hi>Tilly,</hi> with thoſe of his Imperiall Maieſty: they forbare not to doe their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt againſt the ſaid King; whom out of pure neceſſity they by this meanes enforced, in hoſtile manner to oppoſe himſelfe againſt all of them.</p>
                     <p>And notwithſtanding that theſe and the like motives, (which for brevities ſake be here omitted) doe ſufficiently iuſtifie his ſaid Maieſties Armes-taking, being he was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to them: yet this is the thing above all the reſt to be conſidered, the deviſes, namely, and vaſt projects of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> not onely famous in diſcourſe all the world over, but ſo farre actually advanced already, and ſo neere to execution; that the very principall Ports of the Dukedomes of <hi>Mecklenburg</hi> and of <hi>Pomerland,</hi> were really already ſeaſed upon; and the Imperialiſts wholly, by this time, buſied in rigging out ſuch a fleete; as might be able not onely to diſturbe the Commerce betwixt the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Kingdomes; but alſo at pleaſure to divert it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. By this meanes ſhould the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> yoake be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18715:113"/> firſt put upon the ſhoulders of the Northerne people; and from thence, (as the fitteſt place for ſuch a purpoſe) might it be flung upon the necks of all other Kingdomes and Common-wealths in <hi>Europe.</hi> And iuſt in the ſelfe ſame manner, and upon no other reaſon; was that moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> without hearing of their cauſe, or any legall formalities of Proceedinge: actually and <hi>de facto</hi> deſpoyled of their iuſt Principalities and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties. The Dukedome of <hi>Pomerland,</hi> likewiſe, without any colour of right at all, contrary to all equity and deſervings, was actually ſeaſed upon; yea, contrary to all covenants and ſincere promiſes of the Emperour: more then barbarouſly entreated.</p>
                     <p>The moſt iuſt King, therefore, ſeeing by the excellent acuteneſſe of that Iudgement which God from on high had endowed him withall; he was eaſily able to foreſee, what all this was likely in the end to tend unto: reſolved to connive no longer, at ſo prevailing and daily more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent a miſchiefe: but iudg'd it to belong to him, and to his neighbour King (againſt whom alſo, theſe and the like projects were a hammering) in time to prevent this encroaching danger. Vnto this was his Maieſty the more provoked, by the ſerious conſideration of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> and the moſt lamentable condition which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few yeeres laſt paſt, it had beene brought unto: wherein he obſerved, that thoſe Princes that were neereſt to him in the bond of Blood or Religion, were partly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed of their Countries and their dignities; and either thruſt into Baniſhment abroad, or tyranniſed upon at home, ſometimes by their equalls; and which worſe is, even by their inferiours otherwhile domineer'd upon, and with skomes and contumelies abuſed. His Maieſty perceiued withall; how theſe Princes with their neighbours, were with a continuall feare kept under; their rights, without all reſpect wrung from them: the <hi>fundamentall conſtitutions</hi>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:18715:114"/> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> overturned; and that the other party might at pleaſure doe what they luſted; were the Princes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the Imperiall Armies. And to caſt the fairer gloſſe of Iuſtice, upon all this; was that moſt extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall unto the <hi>Evangeliacall Electors,</hi> States, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; The late <hi>Imperiall Decree</hi> pretended, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church goods, (forſooth) and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                     <p>By theſe devices, was there nothing of the ancient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, Cuſtomes and Conſtitutions, left unviolated: the peace, both of Church and Common-wealth, was diſturbed; the <hi>Sanctions</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the Empire, prophaned, the orders for convoking and holding of <hi>Diets,</hi> abuſed, broken, and ſubverted; the articles and practice of Commerce with neighbour States, innovated and diſtracted: yea all places tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole wide Empire, filled with complainings, teares and ſighings. All theſe miſeries, did ſo cordially affect that bleſſed King and moſt valiant Champion: (who being a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, Evangeliacall</hi> neighbour Prince, had alſo his ſhare in theſe ſufferings, and was by the pride and inſolency of the adverſaries, withall enforced to take Armes) that he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it well became him, not to be forgetfull of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his owne blood and Religion; and that he ought, withall, to give way unto that evident <hi>Divine calling,</hi> which preſſed him to endeavour the delivery of Gods people.</p>
                     <p>And what event hath followed upon this his reſolution, from the firſt undertaking unto this very day: is ſufficiently every where made manifeſt. Namely, that his Maieſty clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, firſt of all, the Coaſts and Port townes of <hi>Pomerland</hi> and of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> of the enemy: reſtored the Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> againe into their Countries, freed the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorate of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> chaſed away the enemy, from the banks of the river <hi>Elb,</hi> and how after the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictory of Leipſich,</hi> he led on his owne Armies, againſt the <hi>Catholike Biſhopricks</hi> and <hi>Electorates;</hi> and how thoſe <hi>Leaguers,</hi> whoſe buſineſſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18715:114"/> chiefly was, which way, handſomelyeſt, to devide the lands of the <hi>Evangeliacal Electors,</hi> Princes and States, and to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bloods: He made to play leaſt in ſight, and to ſhift themſelves away out of their owne houſes; which they, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles, ſuppoſed had beene ſo ſurely founded.</p>
                     <p>By which victorious proceedings of his Maieſty, the whole courſe of the buſineſſe was ſo turned about againe; that the Electors, Princes, and States <hi>Evangeliacall</hi> in the Empire: who muſt ſuffer, before, and ſay nothing, tooke cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, now, to put their heads into the world againe, and to looke after the recovery of their ancient liberties and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: yea, and to grow ſo bold upon it, as to goe thorow with the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Leipſich;</hi> and to reſolue upon ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions there, as apparently made ſhow of their purpoſe to conſerve and defend the declining liberties, both of their Country and their Conſciences: yea and boldly to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration unto the Emperour, of their being ſenſible of the vniuſtneſſe of his Proceedings. And notwithſtanding that before the <hi>Decrees</hi> of that <hi>Diet,</hi> could be brought to perfection; they were by the over-powring inundation of the Imperiall and <hi>Leaguer</hi> Armies, waſht away into nothing; and their aſſumed weapons, beaten out of their hands againe: yet did the ſelfe ſame Princes after the <hi>Leipſich Victory,</hi> ſo well recollect their deiected courages; and the greater part of them by ſingle and private confederacies, ſo inter-league themſelues with the Maieſty and Crowne of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by re-aſſuming the performance of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of that <hi>Diet,</hi> or by ſome other reall and actuall engagement, they did wholly commit themſelues unto his Maieſties ſole direction and protection.</p>
                     <p>And thus, from that time untill this; together, with the ſaid King, have they taken up Armes, together, with, and for the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> againſt the Emperour and the <hi>Leaguers.</hi> Which Armes, hitherto, (the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> them graciouſly aſſiſting) have they honourably maintained: and though with much perill, yet not without much happineſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:18715:115"/>
                     <p>His Maieſty, of ever honoured memory, had of long time, verily, deſired nothing more; then how he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate the <hi>Evangeliacall</hi> Electors, Princes, and States, by a common league, into one and the ſame Body of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. But for that the power of the enemy, ſtill with ſuch fierceneſſe preſſed in upon him; he could never find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at ſo much good leiſure, as the bringing about of ſo difficult a buſineſſe would require of him. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, He iudg'd it moſt conducing to the common intereſt, to enter into ſome particular, and as it were preparatory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies in the meane time: that the Cauſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, might effectually goe on, untill ſome fairer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of occaſion might at length bee preſented unto his Maieſty; as well to provide for his owne and their ſafeties; as alſo to make vp one common tye and obligation betweene them. Vntill the happineſſe of which opportunity, hee thought to uphold and continue on the buſineſſe, by the love of their common ſafeties; and by the counſels and aſſiſtance of the Crowne of <hi>Sweden:</hi> which, for the time being, might countervaile a more formall Confederacie.</p>
                     <p>But for as much, as by reaſon of the continuall expeditions and Marchings from place to place, that he was ſtill put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; he could never haue ſo much good leaſure, as to begin thoſe faire Courſes, nor to ſettle a better order for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of <hi>Military Diſcipline:</hi> it is thereby come to paſſe, that not onely whole Provinces (as in ſuch deadly warres it ever falleth out, and eſpecially where the Field of Warre is ſo univerſall) have beene waſted and much ſpoyled; but the licentiouſneſſe of the ſouldiery growne to that head; as that without a ſpeedy remedy, the whole action muſt of neceſſity come to nothing. Verily, his Maieſty of ever glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious memory, had thought of nothing more ſeriouſly: and out of the fatherlyneſſe of his care to the common Cauſe, had endeavoured nothing more diligently, then to have made his perſonall reſidence amongſt the Princes, in theſe <hi>Vpper Parts</hi> of the Empire; and with his owne neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18715:115"/> not onely the more to have aſſured the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Circles,</hi> (according as hee had begun already) but how alſo he might have beene perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a <hi>Diet</hi> of theſe foure <hi>Circles,</hi> for the concluding of ſome ſettled good orders; how the ſomething decayed <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> might have beene repaired.</p>
                     <p>And notwithſtanding that my ſelfe for mine owne part, was ſo ſtonyed with the dolefull and moſt lamentable death of my ſaid deare Lord and Maſter; as that I ſeemed to have cauſe enough to give over any more dealing in theſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and to leave the managing unto their handlings, whom ſo deeply it concerned: yet upon maturer conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how eaſily in the middeſt of theſe fierceneſſes of the enemy, there might betide ſome notable confuſion, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Armies or the Princes: and that the whole Cauſe might of its owne weightineſſe, fall to ſo low a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as were not eaſie afterwards to bee repaired: and that by this meanes, all the Counſels, proceedings, deſignes and victories of my ſaid ſacred Lord the King; would come to no other end nor purpoſe, but to the giving occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the finall and totall ruine of all his Confederates and Part-takers: I had rather lay aſide mine owne private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to mine ſelfe, then ſo abruptly to deſert the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>For this onely reaſon, therefore,<note place="margin">This clauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, does cleerly enough confute that ſcandall of the dead King; How that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a publike pretenſion, he ſought meerely his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt: which was the Empire. This if ſo, why ſhould the <hi>Swediſh</hi> kingdome now continue on the warres? Seeing their King is dead, and their young Queene, not capable of being Emperour.</note> have I ſo earneſtly hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endeauoured, to uphold the buſineſſe; and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly (according to my power) ſo to diſpoſe of all opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, as might ſuite to the beſt advantage of the publike. Yea, and not onely ſo, but I have beene an earneſt ſuiter withall unto the <hi>Crowne of Sweden;</hi> that the State would bee pleaſed ſtill to continue on the warre; that that moſt commendable and praiſe worthy intention of His Sacred MAIESTIE: might obtaine the deſired and intended iſſue. In this my ſuite I have ſo farre prevailed; that I have already from thence received a full <hi>Commiſſion,</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:18715:116"/> to treate and conclude with the Electors, States, and Princes of the Empire, upon that matter: and if I find the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates and Partakers ſo inclined, I have power from the Royall Heyer and Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in their names to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on the worke to a perfection.</p>
                     <p>For mine owne part, therefore, I would ſee nothing with more gladneſſe, then a <hi>Generall Diet</hi> of all the <hi>Evangeliacall Electors</hi> Princes and States, of the whole ſacred <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> together. But foraſmuch as Summer is now neere at hand, and that the enemy is notably by this time, upon the growing hand; and earneſt in his preparations for ſome new expedition: and for that theſe 4. <hi>Vpper Circles</hi> are not onely round encompaſſed by the common enemies; but have them already within their very bowels: therefore, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger in delaies, and for that a <hi>Generall Diet</hi> could not be convoked without much time ſpending, and its peculiar ſolemnities, (by which meanes the whole buſineſſe would be in danger in the meane time to be rather ruined then remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo long it would be before a publike and ioynt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation could be agreed upon: therefore have I thought it more neceſſary, (which alſo was ſollicited and deſired by divers States both of this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Part</hi> of the Empire, and the <hi>Vpper Saxony</hi>) that upon the death of my ſaid Soveraigne Lord the King, to deferre the procuring of a <hi>Generall Diet,</hi> and ſo to haſten on the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> as out of hand to bring it to concluſion. This my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo ſoone as it was made knowne unto divers of the moſt Illuſtrious and Right Honourable Princes and States; there was occaſion given and meanes proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for another new meeting, for the cauſes before rehearſed.</p>
                     <p>And here I render all due and humble thankes, both to the Princes and States perſonally here aſſembled, and to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the abſent, ſeverally and altogether: for that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earneſt invitation of my good intention; they diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to give this meeting. And now moſt earneſtly doe I
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18715:116"/> beſeech you all, that you would take to heart and with matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſider upon the common eſtate of the <hi>Cauſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacall;</hi> and with your prudenteſt and providenteſt conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and readieſt of your aſſiſtance; promote and ſet forward the common buſineſſe of the Empire, the ſafety of your native Country, and your owne proper welfares. And moſt heartily doe I deſire of God, that you may haue profitable deſignes, happy expeditions, and all proſperous and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſucceſſes.

                                 <p>1. That all the <hi>Evangeliacall Electors,</hi> Princes,<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and States of theſe 4. <hi>
                                       <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Circles</hi> now aſſembled, would conclude an Vnion in the beſt forme; and confederate and colleague them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together, with ſuch firme conditions; as never to breake off againe, untill the deſired ſcope: that is to ſay, the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Evangeliacall Electors,</hi> Princes, and States, and the fundamentall lawes of the Empire, be obtained; and due ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made to the Hereditary Princeſſe and Crowne of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
                                    <pb n="222" facs="tcp:18715:117"/> Much leſſe deſcend into any particular treaties with the enemy; but one be made to ſtand for all, and all as one man, untill the full and finall deciſion and determination of the whole buſineſſe be agreed upon. And in caſe ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, ſhould have a mind to fall off from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon League; that conſideration be had, and a decree before hand made, how ſuch a man ought to be thought of, and in what manner handled.</p>
                                 <p>2. It is alſo to be conſidered upon, now that the Emperour after his agreement made and ſworne, having done nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, but the oppreſſion of the Empire and the loyall States in it: and the <hi>Catholicke Leaguers,</hi> alſo, having added to the oppreſſion as much as lay in their power; that is to ſay, helpt it forward, provoked one another to it, and backt one another in it; and hath wrung or beaten the <hi>defenſive Armes</hi> of the Electors, Princes and States <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> out of their hands: whether it were not the beſt courſe openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare both Emperour and <hi>Leaguers,</hi> enemies, and ſo long to hold them for ſuch, untill ſatisfaction be made unto the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and unto the <hi>Electors,</hi> Princes and States offended.</p>
                                 <p>3. It ought alſo thorowly to be conſidered and agreed upon, how many Armies be to be ſent againſt the enemy, and how they are from time to time to be re-enforced: and where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to be raiſed for it.</p>
                                 <p>4. What is the beſt meanes for getting of moneies, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, Ordnance, and Victualls; and what paies are to be made unto the Generalls: as alſo for the horſes to draw the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the Baggage Wagons; and how all this money is to be raiſed.</p>
                                 <p>5. That the courſe of the whole Proceedings may the more orderly be carried, it will be neceſſary that ſome <hi>Office of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
                                    <pb n="223" facs="tcp:18715:117"/> be legally ſet up and authoriſed: and that in other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in like manner, ſome legall determination be now agreed upon.</p>
                                 <p>6. And conſequently, after this <hi>Office of Direction</hi> be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon and authoriſed; it will be very worthy conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the next place, how the <hi>military Diſcipline</hi> may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be better ordered, the Countries freed from the feares and inſolencies of the ſouldiery, and Trading reſtored: and though not every thing, yet how the groſſer abuſes may be remedied.</p>
                                 <p>7. And if it pleaſes the Kingdome of <hi>Sweden,</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to engage it ſelfe in theſe actions; it ſhall bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conſideration, how long it is fitting for it to ſtand engaged: and what aſſiſtance ſhall the ſaid Kingdome of <hi>Sweden</hi> expect againe, if in the meane time it ſelfe ſhall happen to bee invaded, or come into other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                                 <p>All theſe Articles, and whatſoever may elſe be thought upon in the time of the deliberation; I doubt not, but the moſt Illuſtrious and Right Honourable States aſſembled; will maturely conſider upon; and will ſo frame their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, as neceſſity and their owne ſafetie requireth: and thus farre forth, am I confident of all and every one of them. To whom againe in generall and particular, I make all humble tender of ſuch faire offices, in which I may beſt ſerve them.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Propoſitions were tendred to the Princes, &amp;c. the very firſt day of the meeting: that is to ſay, after the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and ſo ſoone as they had taken their places in the <hi>State-houſe.</hi> To theſe, after mature deliberation, the Princes punctually thus anſwered, Article to Article.</p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:18715:118"/>
                     <p>1. That they were all deſirous to contract a moſt firme League amongſt themſelues, and with the Crowne of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> and ſo long time conſtantly to hold it on, untill the deſired libertie of <hi>Germany,</hi> as farre as concerned either <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Temporall Eſtate;</hi> were obtained: and that the Crowne of <hi>Sweden</hi> were ſatisfied their charges of the Warres.</p>
                     <p>2. They thought it better for the time, to forbeare declaring the Emperour and <hi>Leaguers,</hi> enemies; untill a <hi>generall Diet</hi> of the whole Empire: and in the meane time to ſet out a publike <hi>Manifeſto</hi> and <hi>Apology,</hi> concerning their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to this <hi>Defenſive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. In the Third Article, they deſired to conſult with his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, (meaning the Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtiern.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>4. And if this Third were once agreed upon, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate concerning the meanes of maintaining the Armies.</p>
                     <p>5. They requeſted his Excellency that he would be pleaſed to take upon himſelfe the <hi>Directorſhip,</hi> for theſe foure <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Circles;</hi> untill the deſired reſtitution were obtained. And leaſt this charge ſhould bee too heauy for him ſingly; they thought to joyne ſome other <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> with him: and if he pleaſed, they would in euery one of theſe foure <hi>Circles,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an Office of <hi>Sub-Directorſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. For reſtoring of the decayed <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> there ſhould be new and certaine Orders conceived and authorized; the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours whereof, ſhould exemplarily bee puniſhed. The Regiments moreouer ſhould be <hi>reduced</hi> and <hi>reformed;</hi> the ſuperfluous numbers of Officers reſtrained; and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and puniſhing of offending ſouldiers, left unto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the place where they were enquartered. Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould alſo, with the Magiſtrates knowledge, be unto the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18715:118"/> Subjects and inhabitants of every place; to defend themſelves as they could againſt plunderers. As for the billetting of the ſouldiers, it ſhould be committed unto the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>7. And whereas the States of <hi>Sweden</hi> had pleaſed to declare their willingneſſe for the entring into a ſtricter Vnion with them; they accepted of the offer with all due thankfulneſſe. And for their parts, they were ready mutually to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to procure them all due ſatisfaction, if his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would be pleaſed to ſhow them how to doe it.</p>
                     <p>Faire Anſweres, all of them. After this, had the <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> his Audience: whoſe <hi>Oration</hi> was, To encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Princes to goe on where the victorious King had left: He in his Maſters promiſing them all due aſſiſtance; and deſiring to be taken into their <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. That the foure <hi>Circles</hi> ſhall be firme one to another in a <hi>League offenſiue</hi> and <hi>defenſiue:</hi> untill ſuch time as they can have vindicated their Liberties againſt the Emperour,<note place="margin">The Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Diet.</hi> Theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes contract into ten.</note> whom they eſteeme as a reall enemy.</p>
                     <p>2. That to maintaine theſe warres, 16000 Horſe and 40000 Foot, are to be leuyed.</p>
                     <p>3. That the monies to be contributed, ſhall be rayſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Taxe of the <hi>Imperiall Matricula,</hi> in the warres againſt the <hi>Turke:</hi> and the ſumme needfull, is to be 12 times as much, as one <hi>Contribution</hi> then was.</p>
                     <p>4. That the <hi>Magazines</hi> are to bee appointed at <hi>Ausburg,

The <hi>Direction</hi> of the whole Warre, ſhall be carryed by his Excellency the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Sweden Axel Oxenſtiern:</hi> who ſhall manage both it and the Affaires of <hi>State,</hi> in the name of the Imperiall States and the Crowne of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. To him ſhall certaine <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> be adjoyned, as <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> one or more from every <hi>Circle:</hi> and ſome likewiſe from the Imperiall Townes of this Confederation.</p>
                     <p>7. That in every <hi>Circle</hi> there be a <hi>Sub-Directorian Office,</hi> to ſee to things belonging to the collecting and disburſing of the monies; the diſpoſing of the Ammunition and the Victuals, and the well ordering of the <hi>Magazins,</hi> in their owne Precincts.</p>
                     <p>8. That the Magiſtrates of every place, ſhall have full Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in their owne hands; and diſpoſe of the levying and muſtering places: as alſo of the Enquarterings and <hi>Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> as they ſhall thinke fitting.</p>
                     <p>9. That the <hi>Military Diſcipline</hi> ſhall be reformed; the weake Regiments broken to complete others: the ſuperfluous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers caſhiered, Recreuts made, ſtrict order kept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant full Payes allowed.</p>
                     <p>10. To this end, the firſt Contribution is to be raiſed in May nevt; and for the procuring of ſufficient Summes, till the exhauſted lands be ſomewhat reſtored: the neighbour States are to be ſought for to lend moneyes. As for the <hi>Neutraliſts</hi> and ſuch other members of the foure <hi>Circles</hi> as are abſent, they are to be put under <hi>Contribution.</hi>

                     <p>11. The <hi>Palatinate</hi> is to be ſurrendred to the <hi>Adminiſtrator;</hi> and all State-holders, Governours and Commanders in the King

                     </p>
                     <p>12. No <hi>Free Quarters</hi> are in any place to be allowed: but the ſouldiers muſt live upon their payes.</p>
                     <p>13. That theſe foure <hi>Circles</hi> ſhall labour with the reſt of the <hi>Evangeliacall</hi> States (of all which, a generall meeting is much wiſhed for) to give ſufficient ſatisfaction to the Crowne of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. That the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall be a confederate on the ſame conditions, as heretofore in the time of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Other Princes may alſo come into the League.</p>
                     <p>15. That the lands belonging to the Empire, ſhall by no meanes be alienated from it, by any contract with a forraine Prince.</p>
                     <p>16. That if any of the Confederate States or Townes in theſe foure <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Circles,</hi> fall off from this League, without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile conſtraint; they ſhall firſt be admoniſhed: and if they then returne not, to be held and dealt withall as an enemy.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chancellour was offered to be Generall of all the Forces: which he modeſtly the firſt time refuſed: but being the ſecond time put to him, he accepted it. And thus you ſee the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in tearmes to be reſtored, <hi>Heidleberg</hi> Towne and Caſtle are ſince rendred: the warres goe well hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. And this is ſome comfort, for the death of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>

                  <head>An Elegie on the King of Sweden.</head>
                  <l>VVHat ſadd newes doth the curious ſtrive to heare?</l>
                  <l>So ſad; he cannot ſafely live, and feare?</l>
                  <l>I ſee in every eye a terror ſtrooke,</l>
                  <l>A griefe too great for credit; ſince we looke,</l>
                  <l>On Kings, as if they were not clay and duſt,</l>
                  <l>Vaine hopes; in whom alone, men vainely truſt.</l>
                  <l>Say if at once, the great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> dy'd</l>
                  <l>In fight; ſuch as would adde to <hi>Caeſar</hi> pride.</l>
                  <l>A death Triumphant, at whoſe ſpreading fall</l>
                  <l>The Empire groan'd, as if t' expired withall.</l>
                  <l>See how the cunning foes ſecurely barke,</l>
                  <l>Venting their malice from truth-hating darke,</l>
                  <l>Reade their State-faces, for their hearts none can,</l>
                  <l>But he who meaſures Heaven with a ſpan.</l>
                  <l>Obſerve their ioy, for ſuch a barbarous thing,</l>
                  <l>As ioy for loſſe, of a moſt manly King.</l>
                  <l>What did you feare day-Owles? he would un-Crowne</l>
                  <l>Your Triple-head, or breake your Idols downe?</l>
                  <l>He ſure had done it, but that God did ſee,</l>
                  <l>It was not much to doe, by ſuch as he:</l>
                  <l>He ſaw we onely lookt upon his ſword,</l>
                  <l>And forgate him, who conqueres, by a word;</l>
                  <l>Since then, ſo much on miracles you ſtand,</l>
                  <l>God can raiſe up ſome weake and feebler hand,</l>
                  <l>Flyes, Vermine, Frogges; ſuch as did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> fright,</l>
                  <l>A Lance of Bulruſh, and a Lambe to fight.</l>
                  <l>God ſure will doe it, and his blood exact,</l>
                  <l>At their foule ſoules, that ioy in ſuch a fact.</l>
                  <l>It is a ſouldiers trade, and pride to kill,</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18715:126"/>
                  <l>He may more ſafely doe, then you wiſh ill.</l>
                  <l>Then doe not triumph on a Lyon dead,</l>
                  <l>Whom living, all your men at armes did dread.</l>
                  <l>Starting aſide, as doe the fearefull brood,</l>
                  <l>From his ſterne eye that rules the gloomy wood.</l>
                  <l>O thou wilt be long liv'd in <hi>Austrians</hi> feare,</l>
                  <l>When thy great name ſhall ſtrike their Nephewes eare.</l>
                  <l>Yet let vs mourne thy loſſe, to all but thee:</l>
                  <l>Who now art mixed with eternity,</l>
                  <l>So was he borne, as he the heire had beene,</l>
                  <l>Of skilfull warre; and victory his twinne:</l>
                  <l>So didſt thou ſhow thy day, and cloſe thy Eeven,</l>
                  <l>As ſome new Planet had appear'd in Heaven.</l>
                  <l>Predominant on Hills, and Vales, and Woods;</l>
                  <l>Vnacceſt Marſhes, and reſiſting Flouds.</l>
                  <l>Witneſſe thy ſwift march on the various ſoyle</l>
                  <l>Of German' paſed, rather with power, then toyle.</l>
                  <l>So art thou come and gone; as thou wert ſent,</l>
                  <l>To ſhow what God can doe, not what he meant.</l>
                  <l>For hadſt thou liu'd one yeere above that day,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Vien</hi> had beene thy ſeate, and <hi>Rome</hi> thy prey.</l>
                  <l>But it was time to dye: leaſt men had ſaid,</l>
                  <l>He was not mortall untill he were dead.</l>
                  <l>And now he lives againe ſo full of glory:</l>
                  <l>His deeds reſiſt the credit of his Story.</l>

Friday morning before day light, April 13. was the time they appointed to make a <hi>Cavalcado</hi> upon his Quarters; and <hi>Lucas Cagro,</hi> Commiſſary Generall of the Cavallery, was the man; that with 1400 horſe in 12 Cornets, undertooke the action. It ſo chanced, that the <hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> the very night before, had received both notice and aſſiſtance; and was both wayes now provided, to entertaine them. The Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtiern</hi> had newly ſent him 400. <hi>Finland</hi> horſe, under the well-tryed Colonel <hi>Stolhanſhe,</hi> who had alſo taken up his lodging upon the ſide of the ſame hill, on which the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> men lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nquartered. Towards them (though not cloſe up to them) the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> that night hitched; giving notice unto <hi>Stolhanſhe</hi> withall, of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> purpoſes, <hi>Don Lucas</hi> knowing nothing, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies knew ſo much; thinkes in the darke morning to get the advantage of the hill-knap, and then to fall downe upon them with the more weight afterwards: he ſtill ſuppoſing his enemie to be in his old Quarters. The hill top that <hi>Don Lucas</hi> thought to have gotten, was the ſame knap which the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> had before poſſeſſed himſelfe of: on the ſide of which, <hi>Stolhanſhe</hi> was alſo lodged. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> thus in the darke morning, with as much ſilence as they could, mounting up the climb of the hill; ſtumbled firſt upon <hi>Stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſhe</hi> and his <hi>Finlanders,</hi> all ready in array to entertaine

The <hi>Fins</hi> charge them upon the croopes: and the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them downe the hill likewiſe. There were 10 freſh <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cornets, now comming into the ſuccour of their fellowes: who meeting them altogether now in rout, turne the bridle in like manner, and runne away with them for company, towards the leaguer. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> had recovered under favour of their owne Canon. In this flight, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> left 5 (8 ſome ſay) Horſemens Cornets behind them, with about 120 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers. <hi>Don Lucas</hi> his Liefetenant-Colonel (whom they called <hi>Generall Adjutant,</hi>) was here taken priſoner: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with 2 Ritt-maſters or Horſe-captaines, ſome few Officers, and divers common ſouldiers; all which were ſent to <hi>Mentz,</hi> to be kept in durance for their ranſome.</p>
                     <p>And now becauſe wee have chanced upon theſe two names, of <hi>Commiſſary-Generall of the Cavallery;</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Adjutant:</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe (I hope) for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our <hi>ſtorie</hi> the better; to digreſſe a little, for the expounding of theſe two offices. I take it, that this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-Generall of the Cavallerie:</hi> is not altogether unlike a <hi>Sergeant Major</hi> of the horſe, in the <hi>Swediſh diſcipline:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond whom, he hath the power of a <hi>Commiſſarie,</hi> for the proviſion of the troopes,<note place="margin">See how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny marching men make up a compleat Brigade: in our Booke of the <hi>Swediſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>

The <hi>General-Adjutant,</hi> that was Leiftenant to this <hi>Commiſſary:</hi> was the Leiftenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to his Regiment. The <hi>General-Adjutants</hi> office, is to bee aſſiſtant to the <hi>Generall:</hi> That is, to be ſent abroad for the giving or ſpeeding of the Generalls commands, to the reſt of the armie.

The cauſe was, for that he upon the hearing of the <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> faction in <hi>Spires,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Spaniſh:</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe at <hi>Mentz,</hi> to depart the citie; and had arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſome of them, for not obeying. The wiſe <hi>Oxenſtiern</hi> willing to gratifie the Ambaſſador, releaſed the arreſt quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reſtored the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> to their Cloyſters.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of April, came the Queene of <hi>Sweden</hi> into <hi>Mentz:</hi> whom the Chancellor with ſome gallanter troopes of horſe, went to meet withall. Diverſe Princes and Gentlemen (both of the Countrey and Armie) went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to receive her Majeſtie as farre as <hi>Coſtum;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> comes to <hi>Mentz.</hi>

                     <p>The Marqueſſe <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> (he that is commonly called ſo) having beene by his Imperiall Majeſtie appointed his Generall heretofore, in this <hi>Circle of the Rhine:</hi>

The Count returned him this anſwere; That he for his part, had commiſſion from the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to take in ſo much of the countrey, as had heretofore beene <hi>Spaniſh:</hi> ſo that every man being obliged to perform his beſt ſervice for his owne Maſter,<note place="margin">The Count of <hi>Embdens</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of it.</note> &amp; to expect his commands only: hee could not ſee that hee ought to yeeld up his poſſeſſion in the place, untill hee ſaw ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for it from the Court of <hi>Bruſſells.</hi> This returne was the Marqueſſe conſtrained to accept of for an anſwere.</p>
                     <p>But the Count of <hi>Embden</hi> very ſuddenly after this, was fayne of himſelfe, to forſake the towne, without receiving any other Commiſſion from <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> then that hee could not from thence be relieved.<note place="margin">His neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> The <hi>Swediſh</hi> troopes alreadie advanced towards the <hi>Moſel,</hi> intercercepted a Courryer

And true it is, that the <hi>French</hi> Army was by the 21 of May,<note place="margin">and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> comne as farre as <hi>Zweibrucken,</hi> (the town of the <hi>Palatine</hi> the Duke of <hi>Deux Ponts</hi>) upon the Weſterne frontiers of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> about 40 miles diſtant from <hi>Spiers</hi> citie.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18715:145"/> which he had yeelded to conſigne over into the <hi>French</hi> Kings hands: and theſe, this Armie now came (though the Elector, perchance, could have better beene contented not to have beene put to it, to make this conſignation) to take poſſeſſion of. One of theſe Fortreſſes, was the towne and caſtle of <hi>Vdenheim:</hi> and this was cloſe by <hi>Spiers,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And theſe are ſome of the reaſons, that conſtrained the Count of <hi>Embden,</hi> ſo ſuddenly to forſake theſe quarters. This is ſure.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18715:147"/> their intention was not to fight, but to retreate; and hitherto they had made thus much good of it.

And yet that which afflicted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> worſe then all this, was, that their enemies ſtill ſoliciting them with renewed Alarmes; they could never be ſuffered either to pitch or ſleepe; nor to take any manner of reſt, night, or day, for 40 houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Being thus enforced to march forwards, ſtill, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; if any encu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance withall, cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to fall among their wagons, or any carriage of their ordna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: either muſt thoſe neceſſary impediments be forſaken, or the mens lives moſt deſperately be expoſed that durſt ſtay behind ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mend or defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The whole Army would never make <hi>Halt</hi> or ſtay, for any private occaſion: and in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retreate, and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue (the groſſe of foot following on as faſt, as might be) till they came to <hi>Lautereck</hi> aforeſaid; full 16 miles of ground from <hi>Gelheim,</hi> (neere which the fight beganne) and as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to march, as ſome other thirtie.</p>

Here ſet they fire unto a many of their wagons; the carriages of their ordnance, they burned;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18715:148"/> and the peeces they drowned in the river <hi>Lauter.</hi> Their ſicke and wounded men, they put upon the horſes that had drawn them; and ſo haſted to the Northward, towards the <hi>Moſel.</hi> Being thus lightned; now double they their march: and from thence to the river <hi>Nah,</hi> (which gave them entrance into the Duchie of <hi>Semmern,</hi> and the <hi>Huntsruck:</hi>) they had ſomething a more champion countrie to doe it in. Here the <hi>Swediſh</hi> gave it over, ſtaying about <hi>Lautereck</hi> awhile to refreſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence, the Armie turned aſide,<note place="margin">and there the <hi>Swediſh</hi> give it over.</note> partly towards <hi>Creutznach,</hi> 15 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the right hand, and North of <hi>Lautereck,</hi> and partly back again to <hi>Altzeim.</hi> The way betwixt the firſt encounter and parting of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, lay ſtrewed with dead, maimed, ſick, and wearyed bodyes, ever and anon; <hi>Spaniards, Italians, Wallons</hi> and <hi>Burgundians:</hi> of which (if you will take the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and the Boores reckning) there were full 2000. The drowned ordnance were found, and weighed up againe. Some 400 (others name 800) wagons, either burnt or left behinde: 40 of which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoping to have caryed away, and therefore not burned,<note place="margin">Their loſſes.</note> fell whole and wholly into the hands of the <hi>Swediſh.</hi> In theſe, were much bedding, braſſe, pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and iron: with ſuch like leaguer-houſholdſtuffe. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers priſoners were taken; and among them, about 60 Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: all which were carryed into <hi>Mentz.</hi> Of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armie that thus marcht away, were there ſaid to be 8000 foot, and 3000 horſe; or neere upon it: which I beleeve not: all which, by the beginning of June, were gotten as farre as the <hi>Moſel;</hi> and ſome part of them already paſſed it. Much encumbrance did they after encounter withall, in the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> countrey.

Thus the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made good their retreate: and though they did it with much hazzard, and many loſſes; yet, al-together, was it a very good peece of ſervice of them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18715:149"/> And (I beleeve) the <hi>Swediſh</hi> were as glad, as the Countrey, that they were ſo cheape ridde of them.</p>

                     <p>And thus ended that expedition of ſo much expectation, of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies into the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> But this is the fortune of the warres, that the maſters of the field muſt now and then take their turnes, and be beaten out of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> part of the Armie, which returned from the fight, to <hi>Altzeim;</hi> went preſently with the Chancellor back againe to <hi>Mentz:</hi> and the other part, that moved towards <hi>Creutznach;</hi> went forward with the <hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> after a while, into the <hi>Huntsruck.</hi> There hee repriſed (though with ſome little adoe, at firſt,) the townes of <hi>Kirchberg, Simmern,</hi> and others; wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had left ſome weake garriſons.

The quarrell was this. The Biſhop <hi>Philip Chriſtofer</hi> of <hi>Spiers,</hi> was now Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> alſo: whither in the yeare 1623, he had beene choſen.

                        </note> but put himſelfe under the <hi>French</hi> Kings protection; and by a <hi>Proclamation</hi> commanded all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of his countrey.

                     <p>Having here made mention of the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> and his <hi>French</hi> dependancie, <hi>Swediſh Neutralitie,</hi> and enmity with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe to repeate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, (though from an ancienter originall) which may conduce to the underſtanding of his <hi>State,</hi> and our <hi>Storie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Philip Chriſtofer,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Spiers</hi> onely; had his ordinarie Reſidence at this <hi>Vdenheim:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">and ſome old diſcontents betwixt the Palſgrave and the Biſhop, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it:</note> concerning which, there had formerly fallen out a controverſie betwixt the laſt Prince Palatine &amp; him, and upon this occaſion In the yeare 1618. the Biſhop had a mind to fortifie this <hi>Vdenheim:</hi> againſt which, the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> thus argued. That the place had beene viewed, and the modell projected by <hi>Spinola.</hi> That it thereby being made ſuſpitious; would become alſo dangerous to his Eſtate; if either his enemies ſhould get in thither,<note place="margin">and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> or the Biſhops in time to come, prove enemies to the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> He urged alſo, that this fortification would hinder his right of ſending convoyes or <hi>Safe-Conducts</hi> by, or through the towne. That it was contrary to the priviledges of the citie of <hi>Spiers;</hi> which was, to have no new Fort ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, within 3 leagues of it. The Biſhop not deſiſting for all theſe reaſons, the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> procures a meeting of ſome Princes at <hi>Heilbrun,</hi> upon it. There did the Duke of Wirtemberg, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Durlach,</hi> and the Earles of the <hi>Wetteraw,</hi> aſſiſt the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> with 4000 armed men, to ſlight and diſmantle the whole Fortification. Hereupon was it thus agreed betwixt the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> and the Biſhop, with conſent of the <hi>Dom-Herren</hi> or <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>Spiers:</hi> that the part betwixt the <hi>Fore-towne</hi> and the Caſtle, ſhould bee left unfortified: and never to be made up, but by conſent of the <hi>Palatines.</hi> That the Biſhop ſhould never put above 30 men into it, for <hi>Day-Warders:</hi> and that in time of warres, the place ſhould be a refuge for the Paligraves ſubjects. But this agreement was in time of theſe late warres then bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Biſhop; when the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> had no power left, to exact the performance of it. But thus much hath the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop now gained by it: that this towne of <hi>Vdenheim,</hi> which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18715:150"/> hee built againſt the will of his friends, he hath now forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for his enemies. The Captaine that now commanded in this <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> having made this denyall to the Biſhops Trumpet; to ſhew him withall how much good earneſt he meant in it: ſet fire preſently upon ſome of the new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings next the caſtle, to prevent the lodging of any enemies in it: and prepares himſelfe throughly for reſiſtance. This was the ſtate of Udenheim, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forſooke the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of all the countrey together, was this. In <hi>Franckendale</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left, (or were to leave) 1200. In <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> 2000. In <hi>Spiers,</hi> 1000; and in <hi>Germerſheim,</hi> about halfe ſo many. In <hi>Neuſtat,</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Bretten, Sintz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim, Pfedderſheim, Germerſheim</hi> and <hi>Fidelſheim;</hi> they left ſome ſmaller garriſons. Some writing tells mee, that <hi>Don Philip de Sylva</hi> did not ſend in thoſe 1000 foot and 5 Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horſe into <hi>Franckendale,</hi> as he had promiſed. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the chiefe command over the <hi>Militia</hi> in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate;</hi> was entruſted, principally, in the hands of Colonel <hi>Metternich,</hi> Governour of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> All the Countrey of Alſatia, was left to the Marqueſſe <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Baden.</hi> But he ſtaid not long in that his regencie. For hearing how ill the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> had ſped in their retreate; that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> armie was returned to <hi>Mentz;</hi> that <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> was comne downe to be Generall about the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Moſel:</hi> and that the paſſages betwixt <hi>Heidleberg</hi> and <hi>Franckendale,</hi> were likely to be every where blockt up, by his horſe quarters: he by mid June drawes all the forces, out of <hi>Spiers</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſheim;</hi> and retires home-wards to the defence of <hi>Alſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> and that which he calls his owne Marquiſate of <hi>Baden.</hi> And into theſe parts, <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> preſently ſent the wars after him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> after the departure of the <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> (for want of other employment) made a deſigne for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Kirchberg;</hi> wherein they had left a garriſon. The <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> had advanced the ſervice, even to the making
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18715:151"/> of a ſaultable breach in the wall;<note place="margin">The <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> beſieging <hi>Kirchberg,</hi>
                        </note> and the mounting of his ſcaling ladders.

And thus was the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> faine to ſound the retreate, and, for that time,<note place="margin">is beaten off againe.</note> to levie his owne ſiege of <hi>Kirchberg</hi> Shortly after this, when, namely, the <hi>French</hi> Armies were comne a little neerer to theſe quarters: and <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> upon his march thitherward, to the ſieges of <hi>Coblentz</hi> and of <hi>Grafen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg:</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in this towne, <hi>Simmern,</hi> and other places, yeelded upon the firſt ſummons: and went off with ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ierly Conditions.</p>
                     <p>This ſiege, was in the end of May, and the beginning of our June: by which time, was <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> comne downe out of <hi>Bavaria</hi> from the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> with commiſſion to command the Armie, in the parts about the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Moſel.</hi>

The place of the towne, is by a moraſſe: the river there, branching out, into at leaſt 20 ſmall Ilets. Before it, is there a hillie and a woodie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The Citie of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> had ſome pretences to it;<note place="margin">The towne deſcribed.</note> and it now was a troubleſome neighbour unto it: that, holding for Prince <hi>Rodolfe William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> ſecond

The walls, ſtrongly beſet with towers, and rundells: the Bulwarks, thick and high: with two wett ditches about them; and on the Eaſt ſide, a little Suburb, waſhed by the river. All this, was very ſtrongly palliſadoed, with ſome outworks to it.</p>
                     <p>A worck is was ſaid to be, of well neere 20 yeares forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Count <hi>Herman Adolph</hi> Count of <hi>Salm Rifferſchet, Statholder</hi> or Governour of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Strasburg</hi> (in which <hi>Benfelt</hi> ſtandeth) and <hi>Deane</hi> of the ſame <hi>Strasburg:</hi>

                     <p>Saturday September the eight, did his Excellencie <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus Horn</hi> advance thitherward. That very night, did his vantguard take in ſome Mills, with the Hoſpitall or cloiſter on the North ſide of the river (which betwixt that and the towne, had many great Ilets and branches) cutting off, and beating in, ſome of theſe townſmen, that had undertaken the guard of them. Munday September the tenth, beganne <hi>Horn</hi> to plant his Ordnance,<note place="margin">The ſiege laid</note> which I heare to be 3 whole Canons, 4 halfe Canons, 12 fielding pieces, and 4 mortars. And now was he engaged upon a hard peece of ſervice, and all eyes were fixt upon the iſſue of it. <hi>Horns</hi> head Quarter, was upon the weſterne bancke of the river, and North ſide of the towne: and on that ſide he begunne his Approaches. His trenches went round from North to South The defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants (twas knowne) were reſolved to diſpute it, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> had here pitcht themſelves upon their hopes, for the command of the whole Biſhoprick of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and for the Lordſhip of all the neighbour <hi>Alſatia.</hi> The <hi>Strasburgers</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18715:166"/> were deeply intereſſed in the ſucceſſe of the Action; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that <hi>Benfelt</hi> was the great hinderer of their traffick; they, by their giving paſſage unto <hi>Guſtavus Horn,</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch an act of enmitie againſt the Emperor, as they muſt now doe like a ſick man; not take ſo weake a <hi>Dos</hi> of <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> as ſhould be but able to <hi>ſtir</hi> the <hi>humors;</hi> but a potion ſtrong enough to <hi>expell</hi> them. If <hi>Horn</hi> prevailed not before <hi>Benfelt,</hi> the weight of the warres would, certainely, fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie on their ſide. <hi>Horn,</hi> therefore, knew well enough, that all their Magazins and their Armories, were at his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus was he backt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oſſa,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Salm,</hi> then reſident in <hi>Zabern</hi> (a good ſoldier) with <hi>Metternich</hi> of <hi>Heidleberg;</hi> had all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their words, that <hi>Bulach</hi> ſhould be relieved: and to cut out <hi>Horn</hi> ſo much worke, otherwhere, by their diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that he ſhould never be able to lie long before <hi>Benfelt.</hi> And thus was the towne backt: ſo that it was a ſiege of the greateſt expectation (though not of ſo much noiſe) next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> that hath beene in theſe latter trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The quiet of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the ſecuritie and profit of the <hi>Strasburgers,</hi> and the Conqueſt of <hi>Alſatia;</hi> much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon <hi>Benfelt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By September the twelfth, were the <hi>Swediſh</hi> maſters of the <hi>Toll-Sconce</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of the town, a good diſtance from it, and upon the third branch of the river. This ſconce had the command of the Bridges over the river <hi>Ill:</hi> and over the Cauſey which led thence into the Suburb. By the taking of this, was the river it ſelfe alſo at their devotion. By the thirteenth, were they Approached within 30 <hi>Rodd</hi> of the outtermoſt <hi>Graff:</hi> and under the command of the enemies Canon. <hi>Horns lines</hi> firſt brake ground, midway betwixt his owne Head quarter and the towne: which he led cranckling in and out, gaining ſtill neerer and neerer upon the towne. They were runne ſloaping along the north ſide of the town and ſo ended right againſt a Bulwarke, on the very Weſt of it. All along this Trench, were his <hi>Batteries, Blinds, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes:</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:18715:167"/> and Redoubts, to watch and ſave the Approaches: and out of this, was begunne another leſſer line, from a great batterie.</p>
                     <p>This leſſer and neerer <hi>Approach,</hi> was runne all along the Northweſterne ſide of the towne, in a halfe Circle, juſt as the towne ditch directed it: of which it was within a few paces. At the weſterly end of this leſſer <hi>Approach,</hi> was the Ditch cut and drained: and there was the <hi>Callerie</hi> led over: of which we ſhall in its time, tell you. <hi>Horn</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his <hi>Approaches,</hi> hath his Pyoners beaten out, now and then, by the townſmens ſallies; who flung the earth in again into the Trenches. And this was done often, for, certainely the place was very well defended. Ever as <hi>Horn</hi> brought his <hi>Lines</hi> neerer, hee alſo brought forward his Batteries. <hi>Strasburg</hi> ſent him ſupplies of Canon, Granadoes, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and Ammunition, (and victualls too) as much as he deſired: ſo that he was nothing ſparing of his lead nor gunpowder. The moſt of thoſe buildings which a Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could have but a cleere view of, from off his Batterie, he beate about the townſmens eares: ſteeples, towers and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, as well as houſes. For the furie of the great and ſmall ſhott, and the terror of the Fire-workes (which had twice alreadie, ſet fire upon ſome Courts of Guard, Centry-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſtables, next unto the rampiers:) was no man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreame hazzard) able to appeare upon the Bullwarke: ſo that though the towne kept ſome peeces of Canon yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmounted upon their wall, yet hardly durſt a Canonier tarry by them, unleſſe when the rampier were to bee aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A triall of this, was made September 13, whenas 30 <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſemen made a dare, cloſe up to the very brinck of the outtermoſt moate, and came off againe without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                     <p>Munday morning December the tenth, was the Imperiall garriſon turned out at the <hi>Ports,</hi> to ſhift for their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Townſmen not ſo much (you ſee) as putting in one Article, in favour of them. The ſame night, did <hi>Guſtavus Horn</hi> perſonally enter into <hi>Colmar:</hi> without exacting any one halfe Dollar from the townſmen. The onely thing that he added unto the Articles, (which was by entreatie too) was, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> might have their old Church again within the towne, with the free exerciſe of Religion, as heretofore they had enjoyed. This being granted, the Lord Commiſſary-Generall and <hi>Reſident, Glazer,</hi>

The charges of the war, moreover, which he ſhould be put unto for the conquering of them, ſhould doubly bee exacted out of their purſes. Theſe offers being ſent unto them, by a fortunate and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Armie; became prevalent at the firſt motion, and were accepted of. Thus eaſily, was <hi>Hagenau</hi> made <hi>Swediſh;</hi> having not ſo much as ſeene the countenance of a <hi>Swede,</hi> till they tooke ſome of them in, to be their garriſon.

                     <p>The chiefe of the quarrell which the Emperor had to him, was for his Religion, and ſome Church-lands; The <hi>Landgraves</hi> complaint againſt the Emperor, againe; was for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18715:177"/> a Sentence (partly) by <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſed againſt him Anno 1623, by which, the towne and Univerſitie of <hi>Maxpurg</hi> in <hi>Heſſen</hi> were adjudged away from him unto his Cozin the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave <hi>Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Heſſen Darmſtat:</hi> a Lutherane by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not ſo point blanck oppoſite unto the Catholicke partie: and whoſe ſonne hath been a diligent inſtrument of the Emperors, to draw the King of Sweden to a Treatie, when he lay at <hi>Mentz;</hi> and ſtill works with his Father in Law the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. Of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Sentence, the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Cullen,</hi> (with him of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>) had been one of the Commiſſioners and <hi>Executioners:</hi> which made the Landgrave ſtomack him.</p>
                     <p>After that the buſineſſe of <hi>Germany</hi> became (on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke</hi> ſide) a <hi>Leaguer-warre,</hi> and a <hi>Quarrell of Religion;</hi> then were the Proteſtants, on all hands laid at; by theſe <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi> as well as by the Emperor; every of them flying upon his next neighbour. Whereas, therefore, the <hi>Landgrave</hi> had chiefely been borne downe by the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cullen,</hi> on the one ſide; and by the neere Abbies of <hi>Fulda</hi> and <hi>Hirſchfeld,</hi> on the other; with theſe he now begins to cry quittance: ſo ſoone (namely) as he findes himſelfe ſtrong enough, and that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had ſo potently already advanced into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make way therefore for this <hi>Landgraves</hi> invading of others; wee will firſt ſhew you, how hee cleered his owne Countrey at home: even then infeſted by the Imperialiſts.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of September 1631 (as in our <hi>Firſt Part</hi> wee have told you) the <hi>Landgrave</hi> returnes from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with ſome aides for the guard of his owne Countrey: and that gallant Cavalier Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon-Weymar,</hi> was alſo at this time with him. The <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> being returned; firſt, muſters up an Armie of ſome 4000 Foot; whereof 3600 were old ſoldiers; the reſt, traind Boores: and amongſt them, 3 Companies of hardie Forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiers and Huntſmen: of which laſt kinde of people, the Princes of theſe woodie countries have a great multitude.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18715:178"/> To theſe 4000 Foot, were 1000 Horſe and 2 peeces of ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance joyned.</p>
                     <p>His quarrell ſeemed chiefely to be intended, againſt the Biſhopricks and Abby-lands: which was as croſſe as might be, unto the late Imperiall <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Ratiſbone.</hi> And not ſo onely, but even againſt the Imperiall familie alſo. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ſecond ſonne, Prince <hi>Rodolph William,</hi> was now Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Hirſchfeld</hi> in <hi>Heſſen-land,</hi> next neighbour unto the <hi>Landgraves</hi> owne poſſeſſions. This yong Prince, upon the reſignation of his Unckle the Archduke <hi>Leopold:</hi> was made Prieſt, and had his Biſhopricks of <hi>Paſſaw</hi> and <hi>Straſburg:</hi> in lieu of which, the Archduke was made Adminiſtrator of all the lands of the houſe of <hi>Gratz</hi> (of which this Emperor is) in <hi>Alſatia, Tirole,</hi> &amp;c. This Princely yong Prieſt, was in the yeare 1628, choſen Abbot of <hi>Hirſchfeld</hi> aforeſaid; and ſhould have beene Archbiſhop of <hi>Madenburg</hi> alſo: whoſe miſſing of it, was the deſtruction of that goodly Citie. He had the Abby of <hi>Hirſchfeld,</hi> with condition, that the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves</hi> right unto the Citie, and the Citizens freedome of religion, ſhould be reſerved. The preſent Abbot and Prince of <hi>Fulda,</hi> was one <hi>Iohn Bernard Schenck</hi> of <hi>Schweinſberg;</hi> Elected Anno 1623. who by the Title of his Abby, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one of the Princes of the Empire. To the towne of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> hath the Landgrave ſome pretences alſo. This towne of <hi>Hirſchfeld,</hi> and the <hi>Abby-lands</hi> about it, (being upon the river <hi>Fulda,</hi> in the very heart of <hi>Haſſia</hi>) were ſince theſe warres, ſtill guarded by ſome Imperiall forces: and military men (for the moſt part) being nothing daintie of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Actions of Treſpaſſes;</hi> had trenched, with the furtheſt, upon the <hi>Landgraves</hi> Royalties, and the Cities <hi>priviledges.</hi> This was another of the greevances. Towards this <hi>Hirſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld,</hi> therefore, ſo ſoon as he came from the King; the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave converts his forces.<note place="margin">He cleeres <hi>Hirſchfeld</hi>

The garriſon anſweres his ſummons, as if they held for <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in <hi>thunder and lightning,</hi> namely, ſuch as they could make with their ordnance. The Landgrave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as if he had Commiſſion from <hi>Vulcan:</hi> for having gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the gate by his Approaches, he claps to a Petard; &amp; by that breach, his ſoldiers ruſh into the City. Then would the garriſon have compounded:<note place="margin">Takes <hi>Fritzlar</hi>

And whereas you in them complaine, of us for our invaſion of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> in anſwere thereunto Wee will not conceale, how heartily ſorry wee are, and how ſenſible; of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſeverall Armyes, which as well from the <hi>Catholicke leaguers,</hi> as others; have for theſe many yeares together, beene ſent into this our deare Countrey of <hi>Germany.</hi> How unchriſtianly and inhumanely, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, and States of the Empire, and our owne dominions in particular, ſince wee came to the Government thereof, have beene u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by theſe Armies: and that againſt all reaſon, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe, and beſides all colour of right and juſtice: wee are yet ſenſible of. And which is worſe then all this: wee yet feele, that when wee and our poore Subjects, did at any time complaine or ſue for juſtice or redreſſe; wee were but ſcorned and rejected for our labours: contrary to all lawes and rights of nations in generall, and unto the <hi>Imperial Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations</hi> in particular: as alſo againſt the peace of <hi>Religion</hi> and of <hi>Policie,</hi> all <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>Circles</hi> thereof. Wee have endured the moſt barbarous uſage that might be, in our ſaid dominions: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarterings, namely, Taxations, Burnings, Robberies, Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of our townes and villages: yea alſo and of putting to the ſword, innumerable innocent ſubjects of ours of all ſorts.<note place="margin">The miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes, before the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Germany: for even thus, were all of them ſerved.</note> But wee haue ſince underſtood, what their intent and drift then was, in ſo doing: by all force and violence, namely, to render us every where odious, and to make a moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beggar of us withall; by at once depriving us of our Countrey, goods, and ſubjects. During all which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of theirs, and moſt lamentable ſufferings of ours; the worſt of all yet was, that upon thoſe infinite complaints, prayers, cryes and lamentations, which both by word of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18715:181"/> mouth, letters and Ambaſſages we made unto his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Majeſty, your ſelfe, and other Princes our Coſins, &amp;c. wee were never able to obtaine ſo much, as that any one of all theſe, would once vouchſafe to take the leſt pitty of our caſes, or ſhew any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> compaſſion towards us: as if wee had utterly beene uncapable, yea unworthy altogether; of any law, Juſtice, kindneſſe, favour, or benefit. By this meanes (God is our witneſſe) wee being become a Prince rejected altogether, by ſuch as beare ſway in the Empire; found our ſelves (and that upon juſt grievances, not to bee longer endured) enforced to take upon us ſuch a reſolution, as is indeed leſſe deſperate and more ſalutarie; then if wee had longer ſuffered and wincked at, the ſaid horrible and moſt enormous proceedings.</p>
                           <p>For this reaſon therefore, have wee made allyance with thoſe, that by the moſt eſpeciall providence of God, and to their owne great hazzard, dangers and expences, are comne armed into <hi>Germany;</hi> to the comfort of the <hi>Evangelicall Profeſſors,</hi> and conſequent'y of our owne ſelves: whom (fighting for the juſt cauſe) God hath already bleſſed with ſuch notable victories, as wee already moſt heartily thanke him for them. Thus being obliged, to ſeeke (by Gods helpe) together with our ſaid Allyes and our ſword, (which our enemies have by force put into our hands) ſuch a Peace and quietneſſe; as wee have not beene able heretofore to obtaine, by any prayers, or any (even almoſt unworthy and unprincely, and therefore unexcuſable) patience, complaints or petitions. Being now by theſe reaſons obliged, to take the ſame courſes, as your ſaid <hi>league</hi> hath given us exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to doe; and being now utterly robbed and deſpoiled of what was our owne, to ſeeke what heretofore was not our owne. Wherefore wee kindly pray you (as being a moſt excellent and high member of the ſaid <hi>Catholike league</hi>) not to take it in ill part, if wee now follow the Rule, which is ſo ſolidly grounded upon <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice, Quod quis iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſtatuerit in alium, eo ipſo, ipſe utatur.</hi> That every man
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18715:181"/> would be content to have the ſame ſentence paſſe upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he hath pronounced upon another.</p>
                           <p>And thus, ſince there cannot at this preſent, any end of theſe <hi>Germane</hi> miſeries be expected; without ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be firſt aſſented unto, whereby thoſe inſupportable grievances of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may before-hand be removed: and without the conſent of ſuch Princes, (not of us alone) as the <hi>Catholicke League</hi> hath by force (as it were) drawne into this warre; and in whoſe hands the right of peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king yet remaineth.

And to the end they might bee no wayes diſturbed in their march on the further ſide of the <hi>Ebb;</hi> the ſaid Duke and Lord ſhould give them their joynt letters, unto the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and of <hi>Lunenburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. That the Officer who ſhould now be appointed to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with, and to command this their <hi>Swediſh</hi> Convoy, ſhould have a charge not to forſake the ſaid Imperialiſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had fully and ſafely brought them to one of the places aforeſaid.

                     <p>4. That this convoy allotted them ſhould take care, that no injurie were offered upon the march unto the Imperialiſts; either by the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> troopes, the Dukes of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> or of <hi>Mocklenburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. That the Imperiall Officers ſhould have horſes ſent them for the carriage of their private baggage and Valeeſes; and for ſuch wounded and ſick men to ride upon, as had no hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

That the Magiſtrates of the citie ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe furniſh them with horſes, for the drawing away of their ordnance: which ſhould alſo be returned by the ſame Convoy. <hi>Virmont</hi> ſhould paſſe his word alſo, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> in their returne ſhould no wayes be moleſted by the Imperialiſts: and that (if neceſſitie ſeemed ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) the <hi>Swediſh</hi> alſo ſhould have a Convoy back againe of ſome of theſe Imperiall Horſe: untill they ſhould be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the danger: which Horſe taking their Hoſtages back from <hi>Roſtock</hi> with them, ſhould by a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Trumpet bee brought home againe.</p>

                     <p>9.

All ſuch workes, as had beene made up of late for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the Citie, ſhould ſo remaine unſlighted: and that for avoiding of all danger, all the new digged mines about the towne, ſhould be diſcovered to the Enterers. The Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alſo ſhould not be plundered nor exacted upon, by the departing Imperialiſts.</p>

                     <p>12. That it ſhould be free for the Duke of <hi>Fridlands</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and Counſellors, either to goe now out of the towne with the ſoldiers, and to carry all their goods and Records with them; or to ſtay behinde ſtill: and to bee aſſured that they ſhould no wayes be damnified.</p>
                     <p>13. Whereas the Armes of the Citizens, had during the ſiege time beene made uſe of by the ſoldiers: all thoſe peeces of Armor which <hi>Virmonts</hi> people had not evident and preſent uſe of, ſhould be left in the towne behinde them.</p>
                     <p>14. If (which God forbid) any ſcarrefire ſhould breake out in the towne, at the going forth of the Imperialiſts; there ſhould no advantage thereupon be taken by the <hi>Swediſh,</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:18715:186"/> to quarrell either <hi>Virmont</hi> or his people: but an examplary and ſevere puniſhment, ſhould light only upon that perſon; by whoſe negligence or miſcheivouſneſſe, ſuch a Caſualtie had beene occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>Theſe 14 Articles being the ſame day agreed, and ſigned by both parties; the next day being Friday October 16. did the Governor <hi>Virmont</hi> march forth of the towne; together with 3200 Foot, two troopes of Horſe, and all other things formerly agreed upon: 150 <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe attending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the towne, to bring them going to the place aforeſaid. The Imperialiſts being arrived about <hi>Wolffenbuttle,</hi> made immediately towards the river <hi>Weſer,</hi> whereabouts the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Tilly</hi> at that time was; whom <hi>Virmont</hi> thought to doe a very good ſervice unto, if he ſhould now joyne with his weake Armie. <hi>Virmont</hi> being upon his march thitherward; was countermanded by the Count of <hi>Manfold,</hi> Governor of <hi>Magdenburg;</hi> then Imperiall Felt-marſhall for the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Saxonie,</hi> and directed to conjoyne himſelfe with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Bonickhauſen</hi> (who had a Regiment neere hand, of 13 Cornets of Horſe) and that they two ſhould preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Halberſtat,</hi>

This when he had ſignified unto the Count of <hi>Mansfeld;</hi> he received a command to repaire to him into <hi>Magdenburg:</hi> which he was bodily afraid, would be beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18715:186"/> by the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> as indeed it was, within a few dayes after.

                        <p>The greater of theſe free, Imperiall, and <hi>Hanſe</hi> townes, being of the <hi>Lutherane</hi> or <hi>Auguſtane</hi> confeſſion; had ſent their Duputies unto the famous <hi>Proteſtant Diet</hi> of <hi>Leipſich:</hi> which being ended April the third, no ſooner were theſe Deputies returned home againe; but they are ſent the ſecond time unto another <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Hamborow,</hi> in the beginning of May following. The conſultation was, in what forme
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18715:187"/> they might ſafelyeſt ſubſcribe unto the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Leipſich,</hi> and how farre engage themſelves in a joynt <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and <hi>levie;</hi> for the defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>Germanie.</hi> But this conſultation, though ſomething was done in it to countenance the cauſe; yet were no publike levyes ſet on foot, to defend it.

Thus hath it oftentimes fallen out in the Empire; divers Common wealths there, having great priviledges, they will league one with another and ſtruggle hard to preſerve them: ſo that when ever <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> hath projected great deſires, then beganne the conflict.

                                    <hi>Tillies</hi> Letter.</note>I Have, to my great wonderment, received newes of late, of that generall meeting of certaine <hi>Proteſtant Electors,</hi> Princes, and States, at the towne of <hi>Leipſich:</hi> and how they have with one conſent there agreed, to raiſe a common and a mighty army among them all; that they have already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18715:187"/> together a great power, and have more forces daylie in levying. Now, that theſe preparations of thoſe princes, could not but with great danger be promoted; and muſt of neceſſitie be the cauſes of a great diſtraction, they all knew: ſeeing that all private armings which were undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the Emperor, did not only occaſion many a ſiniſter ſuſpition among the people; but were flatly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forbidden to be made, by the fundamentall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Empire. Having aſſurance, therefore, of their preſent conſultation at <hi>Hamborow,</hi> for the beſt way of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing unto the ſaid <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Leipſich;</hi> he could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them friendly, that in their ſaid conſultation, they would make this the chiefeſt of their thoughts, how they might preſerve their Faith and obedience unto <hi>Caeſar.</hi> His adviſe unto them, therefore was, that they ſhould be chary of withdrawing themſelves from the Emperors ſervice, who was their Soveraigne Magiſtrate: but that as faithfull and good ſubjects, they ſhould perſevere rather in their due obedience; not ſuffering themſelves to be drawne aſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any contrary undertakings. He wiſht them ſeriouſly to conſider withall, how that as all their ſafeties and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, did ſolely and wholly depend upon their Lord the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: ſo on the contrary, was there nothing to be expected from other princes (and from forrainers eſpecially, who meerly intended their owne private) but the loſing of their priviledges and Commerce, the ruine of their States, and the neceſſary drawing on, of a publick ſervitude.</p>
                              <p>How frequently hath experience taught us, what miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble events hath unevitably befallen thoſe people, that have leagued againſt his Imperiall Majeſtie, and had embroyld themſelves in a warre againſt him.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18715:188"/> them of perſevering in their due loyaltie and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

And let this be the <hi>gloſſe</hi> to the Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> reaſons, that they were preſſed by an enemie. However, their owne feares prevailed with them; and what they did next, they did more privately. Their wills were ſtill good unto the Cauſe; and they underhand promoted the Decrees of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſich.</hi> Thus as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> grew ſtronger, they grew more courageous: and when the Proteſtant Princes ſtruck in alſo with them, then was there another aſſemblie a little more boldly talkt upon.</p>
                        <p>Greene wood laid neere the fire, naturally ſhrincks up it ſelfe, contracts its owne pores and openneſſe, by which the flame might enter it; that by a neerer uniting of its parts, it might prepare it ſelfe for reſiſtance. The ſame operation had the burning of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> (now newly this moneth done) upon theſe its neighbour and confederate Cities: it did as much arme, as terrifie them. The King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, dayly more and more prevailing; ſome of the Princes of this <hi>Circle,</hi> beganne to take Commiſſions from him, to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and arme for him: he became the Protector of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18715:188"/> libertie; and under him, they ſingly promoted their perſonall pretences. The Duke of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> as next heire to the Dukedome of <hi>Brunſwick;</hi> (the preſent ruling Duke <hi>Vlrick,</hi> having no likelyhood of iſſue,) he armes to put in for that, which <hi>Tilly</hi> had almoſt devoured.

                        <p>The Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> being throughly now defeated, as if the weight of his former reaſons, had growne lighter with the decay of his power; the whole <hi>Circle</hi> in November fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, appoint a more generall meeting at the ſame <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow;</hi> whither all the Biſhops, Princes and States either came, or ſent their Ambaſſadors. Here they reſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for the levying of 3 new Regiments, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charges of the <hi>Circle:</hi> the purpoſe being, to cleere the countrey of the new encroached Imperialiſts. The firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was undertaken for, by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bremen,</hi> the Duchy of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> and <hi>Zella-Brunſwick,</hi> with the Biſhopricks of <hi>Lubeck, Brunſwick,</hi> and <hi>Hildeſheim.</hi> This was to conſiſt of 1950 Foot, and 127 Horſemen. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Regiment was to be raiſed by the Dukedom of <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg,</hi> the countrey of the <hi>Lower Saxonie,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ratzenburg,</hi> and the citie of <hi>Lubeck:</hi> which was to bee 1675 Foot, and 366 Horſe, ſtrong. The third, which was to be of 1448 Foot onely; was to be raiſed and paid by the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Schwerin.</hi> All theſe were to be joyned to Duke <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Lunenburgs</hi> owne Armie: he being to be Generall over them.</p>

                        <p>This was much about the twentieth of our December: and whileſt the Captaine is upon his way, the ſtrong towne of <hi>Damitz</hi> was yeelded up: and that we now turne to.</p>

The Governor of it, was Count <hi>Wolff</hi> of <hi>Manſvelt:</hi> and his garriſon, ſome 3000. The L. Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Generall <hi>Banier;</hi> ſate downe to it; about the middle of November: their Quarters for the Foot-forces, being in 2 Dorps, about two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles ſhort of the towne, towards <hi>Saltz,</hi> the <hi>Elb</hi> being on their right hand. Both the Generalls, were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in one of thoſe villages, where the Foot lay: which were ſuch decayed forſaken cottages; that the houſes were neither enow, nor ſufficient, to keepe the men dry. And thus had <hi>Tillie</hi> left the Countrey. <hi>Baniers</hi> Horſe, were quartered in the next Dorps on the left hand of <hi>Magden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg:</hi> the neereſt at the diſtance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile: though their guards were neerer. Both Horſe and Foot, might come to 6 or 7000 men. Workes they had none againſt the towne, but only 3 Skonces: firſt, a greater one, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a hill, halfe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from the citie: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, another to guard the Avenue of their Quarter; and a third upon the right hand by the <hi>Elbs</hi> ſide, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed never finiſht. Generall <hi>Banier</hi> was, for the moſt part in the Quarters: though now and then he made a poſting voyage to <hi>Hall;</hi> 44 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the Southward: where about this time his wife lay in; and <hi>Bauditz</hi> was one of his Goſſips.</p>
                        <p>Peeces of ſervice, there were onely theſe 2, all the time of the 7 weekes leaguer. The firſt was, (about the middle of the ſiege) upon a little Iland in the <hi>Elb:</hi> to which the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18715:192"/> townſmen uſed to ſend their Boats, a fuelling. This being obſerved, ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot were ſent out againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom fell a ſlight skirmiſh, not worth relating.<note place="margin">Two ſlight skirmiſhes.</note> The miſchance was more remarkeable, then the encounter: for that a ſparke of fire lighting into the powder, in one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> boats; blew that up, and the aſſailants in it. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſervice was towards <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and by the horſe: 300 of whom being put over to the further ſide of the <hi>Elb;</hi> there intercepted ſome of the towne garriſon, that were ſent over the bridge for forage.</p>
                        <p>The towne, by <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> eve, was brought to a <hi>Parlie,</hi> in which, had <hi>Banier</hi> beene as forward as my Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, the towne might have beene rendred. Three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were on both ſides appointed for the treaty:<note place="margin">The towne Parlies:</note> a Colonel, a Leiftenant-Colonel, and a Sergeant-Major. The Leiftenant Colonel, ſent from the Beſiegers, was named <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Adams</hi> (as I take it) who is now Governor of the towne: and the Majors name is <hi>Chamberlaine.</hi> The place of treatie was betweene the Quarters and the towne; each ſide bringing a guard of 100 foot, and 50 Horſemen. The conditions offered being ſomething preſſing, the towne Commiſſioners anſwered, that they were not as yet in ſuch neceſſitie; but if they might have faire termes they would be willing to ſurrender. On Wedneſday they met againe: but nothing was concluded: <hi>Drummes</hi> and <hi>Trumpets,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill betweene, from the towne unto the leaguer. The night following, there ſlipt 2 of <hi>Pappenheims</hi> horſemen into the town ſo that the L. Marqueſſes Trumpet being next day ſent in, with a full expectation to bring the newes of yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the Count of <hi>Mansfeld</hi> returned this peremptory word by him, that he deſired to be excuſed,<note place="margin">Broken off, upon the newes of <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheims</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> he could not with his honour continue on the Treatie; for that he had intelligence that his ſuccours were marching: <hi>Pappenheim</hi> would bee there by ſuch a day and houre; and that would hee truſt unto.</p>
                        <p>A Comfort, as cold as the ſeaſon. Newes being ſtill
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18715:193"/> brought of <hi>Pappenheims</hi> comming: upon <hi>New-yeares</hi> day would <hi>Banier</hi> needs be riſing.

                        <p>To returne to the ſiege.

However, the leader of the ſallyers was there ſhot dead and fell; his men forced to retire: being after ſome skirmiſhing, beaten into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ports of their Citie.

                        <p>The ſiege went on in the meane time, and the Canon from all 3 Batteries did their duties: faggots and ſtorming lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were alſo made ſhew of; nor yet would theſe offers fright out the beſieged.

                        <p>Thence were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent to block up <hi>Stoade;</hi> about which, the reſt of the Army were quartered up and downe in Dorps; the ſnow not then ſuffering them to lye in open Quarters.

Thus would they give a <hi>Camiſado,</hi> beat and fire a Quarter, now and then; and ſo in againe, never ſtanding to it to make good any thing. And thus went on the buſineſſe, all this

By this, were the townſmen ſtarck mad, reſolving to have torne the Baron in peeces; had not 2 Lords privately brought him off in their Coach; ſet him privately downe behinde the <hi>Cathedrall:</hi> whence at midnight hee was ſhifted out of the Citie, unto his owne Caſtle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg:</hi> 32 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the North Eaſt of <hi>Breſlaw:</hi> whence he eſcaped to <hi>Vienna.</hi> Hence was he ſent into <hi>Poland</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:18715:219"/> where he raiſed ſome thouſands of <hi>Coſacks,</hi> with whom he returned into <hi>Sileſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this mans indiſcretion, had this faireſt City of <hi>Sileſia</hi> like to have beene undone; by his offering the firſt act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie againſt the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> who were al this day in hot skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with the Imperialiſts. Wedneſday morning, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann againe; the fight continuing till 8 a clock: at which time was ſhooting given over on both ſides. The reaſon was, for that the Imperialiſts, at that inſtant, retyred to a place called <hi>Clarworder,</hi> not farre from the <hi>Oder:</hi> leaving ſome troopes to maintaine the Bridge; notwithſtanding.<note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts retyre a little.</note> Towards evening, the Imperialiſts ſent divers of their beſt baggage-wagons, with 4 great peeces of Ordnance, (each drawne by 20 or 24 Horſes) and a goodly <hi>Mortar,</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into <hi>Breſlaw:</hi> for feare (as the meſſengers ſaid) leaſt the Imperiall Army in their retreate, ſhould be forced to leave them to their enemies. The gunnes were taken in; for that the citie could anſwere for them: they having lent more peeces then thoſe, unto the Emperor. As for the Baggage, they would not meddle with it: for feare the ſheltering of enemies goods, ſhould occaſion a quarrell with the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons:</hi> who had yet done no injury to the townſmen.</p>
                     <p>That night was there command given thorow the Citie, that every Burger upon pain of loſing his <hi>Freedome;</hi> ſhould meet the next morning at the Statehouſe. There and then, were theſe 5 demands made, from <hi>Don Balthaſar</hi> and the Imperiall Army.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether the Citie would ſtand firme to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And ſerve his Armie with victualls and Ammunition?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In caſe the Army ſhould not be able to maintaine it, (as they feared) againſt their enemies: whether they might have the favour to retreate into the Citie?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whether they would grant paſſage to the Army, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the towne?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And if their Armie were put to the retreate, whether
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18715:220"/> the Citie would favour them with their Ordnance from the walls, and ſo afford them their beſt aſſiſtance?</p>
                     <p>The Cities anſwere was.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Emperor, they were reſolved, as they were obliged, to live and die.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Victualls and Ammunition for the Armie, they could not ſpare them: becauſe that little they had there was need enough of, in ſo populous a Citie. And yet if they could be aſſured, how their towne ſhould be maintained againſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> &amp; <hi>Saxons;</hi> they would afford whatever they found their Magazines able to ſpare them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for the retreate of the Armie into their Citie; that might they by no meanes afford them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As for leave of marching thorow their Citie; that could they not imagine how it could bee convenient either for the towne or Armie: for that ſeeing they muſt likewiſe afford the ſame favour to the <hi>Swediſh;</hi> they ſhould thereby bring their citie into a moſt eminent danger.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As for favouring them with their Ordnance from the walls, until they ſhould have made their retreate far enough; that were farre leſſe expedient for them. And therefore they would intreate the Army to conſider, how much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience muſt needs be drawne upon the City by it. For whereas the <hi>Swediſh</hi> had hitherto offered no hoſtility; either unto the City or any belonging to it; they had no reaſon to provoke them firſt of all: which if they ſhould doe, they ſhould never be able to give an account for it to poſteritie. This courteſie they hoped for from the Imperiall Army; that if the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſhould offer to aſſault their Citie, they would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ready to relieve it. The towne having thus handſomly declined, rather then denyed theſe demands: the Imperiall Officers all abaſhed at it, repaired to their leaguer.</p>
                     <p>About noone the ſame Thurſday, came there a letter unto the Magiſtrates, from the Generall <hi>Dubalt:</hi> full of good language and profeſſion. Therein was the ſincerity of his

Friday the laſt of Auguſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning, the reſt of the Imperiall Army brake up, and came before the <hi>Oder</hi> gate; and ſo retyred into the ſaid Suburb. Here ſtaid they not full 2 houres:<note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts flee.</note> but in great haſt retyred themſelves, ſome North Eaſtward to <hi>Namſtau;</hi> others North Weſtward to <hi>Auris:</hi> whence twas thought they would have gone out of the countrey. About noone the ſame day, came the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ruſhing into the ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb of <hi>Elbing,</hi> having by boates gotten over the <hi>Oder.</hi> Here made they havock of whatſoever the Imperialiſts had left behinde them, but doing no wrong unto any of the <hi>Breſlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Juſt then was newes brought, that other <hi>Swediſh</hi> had ſlaine 200 Imperialiſts, taken Colonell <hi>Rotſtall</hi> priſoner, with 300 horſemen more, at <hi>Olaw</hi> bridge; 16 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles to the South Eaſt of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> which were there ſet to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Paſſe over the river <hi>Olaw,</hi> which falleth into the <hi>Oder</hi> at <hi>Breſlaw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saturday morning September the firſt, the Citizens of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> were to meet in the Statehouſe: and there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves, whether they would admit the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Armies into their towne: make an accord with them: or otherwiſe runne the hazzard of hoſtilitie? And thus farre my <hi>Breſlaw</hi> Author, hath beene my Intelligencer.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that had taken <hi>Roſtall</hi> at <hi>Olaw</hi> bridge aforeſaid; were of <hi>Arnheims</hi> Armie: who whileſt <hi>Dubalt</hi> was thus

And hee having underſtood that the Imperialiſts had another Bridge over the <hi>Oder,</hi> right againſt <hi>Olaw</hi> aforeſaid: thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goes hee about Auguſt the twentie ſixth, to force that; and that way to come at the Imperialiſts.<note place="margin">

                        </note> Now whiles <hi>Rotſtall</hi> ſtayes too long to burne downe the Bridge, there was he taken and his men defeated.

                     <p>The calamity of this Prince, hath beene taken up for a <hi>Theme</hi> by a many licentious tongues, and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed pennes; to declaime againſt him: they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves upon the ſucceſſe and bad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his affayres, to make judgement of his mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: taking leave moſt outragiouſly to detract from him, with an unmanerly and ful-mouthd liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18715:224"/> hath left behinde him: which promiſes them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affranchiſement, one day againe; and the reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a <hi>Family</hi> ſo many wayes conſiderable, as is one of the firſt and ancient lieſt deſcended, of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> A Queene, who for her beautie, and vertues; demerits to be made no leſſe, then what ſhee was <hi>borne,</hi> or <hi>Crowned:</hi> and who for the unexampled bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe varied afflictions, deſerves to be made more, then there are yet <hi>Titles</hi> for. An Iſſue ſo faire; and for their numbers, ſuch a bleſſing: as were not onely prepared by God, for a preſent Comfort to their widowed Mother: but, (which their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent towardlineſſe, gives pregnant hopes of) for the raiſing of their owne faire <hi>Family</hi> againe; and engrafting the <hi>Palatine</hi> branches, into moſt of the great <hi>Houſes</hi> of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The Reader (I hope) will not take it amiſſe from me, that I have done that right, unto ſo great a Prince; which in all duty and conſcience I felt my ſelfe obliged to. A Prince, who hath theſe many yeares beene the Butt of misfortunes, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies and inſultations, which, of courſe, follow upon them. And this have I done, ſo much the more confidently; for that this Prince hath had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of allyance, not onely with other great Kings; but alſo with mine own gracious Soveraigne. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all perſons of honour, ought of right to eſteeme themſelves intereſſed, in the chary conſervation of the honours of their equalls; and however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diverſly affected, yet ſhould they all joyne to reſcew one another from malignity; and to palliate their diſgraces, with their very Crownes &amp; Purples.</p>
